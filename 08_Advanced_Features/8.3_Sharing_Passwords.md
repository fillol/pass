# ✨ Sharing Passwords with Other GPG Users

**Page Objective:** This page explains how to configure `pass` to encrypt specific passwords or entire subfolders for multiple GPG users, enabling secure password sharing with trusted individuals.

`pass` leverages GPG's ability to encrypt data for multiple recipients. This is useful for sharing family passwords, team credentials, or any situation where more than one person needs access to the same encrypted information.

## 1. The `.gpg-id` File(s)

The core of sharing in `pass` revolves around the `.gpg-id` file.
*   A `.gpg-id` file in the root of your password store (`~/.password-store/.gpg-id`) specifies the default GPG key(s) for which all new passwords will be encrypted.
*   You can also place a `.gpg-id` file inside any subfolder. Passwords created within that subfolder (or its children, unless they have their own `.gpg-id`) will be encrypted for the GPG IDs listed in *that specific folder's* `.gpg-id` file, overriding the root one for that path.

## 2. Prerequisites for Sharing

1.  **Recipient's Public GPG Key:** You need the public GPG key of each person you want to share passwords with. They should export their public key and send it to you.
    ```bash
    # On their machine, they would run:
    # gpg --export --armor THEIR_GPG_KEY_ID > their_public_key.asc
    ```

2.  **Import and Trust Recipient's Public Key:** On your machine (where you manage the `pass` store and will be adding their ID), you need to import their public key and ideally sign it/set its trust level.
    ```bash
    # Import their public key
    gpg --import their_public_key.asc

    # Edit their key to set trust (optional but good practice)
    gpg --edit-key THEIR_GPG_KEY_ID
    # At the gpg> prompt:
    # gpg> lsign  (to locally sign their key, confirming you've verified it)
    # gpg> trust  (set a trust level, e.g., 1=I trust marginally, 2=I trust fully)
    # gpg> save
    ```
    You need to know their GPG Key ID (the short ID, long ID, or fingerprint of their primary key or, ideally, their encryption subkey).

## 3. Sharing All Passwords (Modifying Root `.gpg-id`)

If you want *all* passwords in your store (or all *new* passwords from this point forward) to be accessible by another person:

1.  Edit the root `.gpg-id` file:
    ```bash
    nano ~/.password-store/.gpg-id
    ```
2.  Add the GPG Key ID of the other person on a new line. Each GPG ID should be on its own line.
    Example content of `~/.password-store/.gpg-id`:
    ```
    YOUR_GPG_ENCRYPTION_SUBKEY_ID
    THEIR_GPG_ENCRYPTION_SUBKEY_ID_OR_MASTER_ID
    ```
3.  Save the file.
4.  Commit the change to Git:
    ```bash
    cd ~/.password-store
    git add .gpg-id
    git commit -m "Add GPG ID for [Recipient's Name] to share all passwords"
    pass git push
    ```

**Effect:**
*   **New Passwords:** Any password created or generated *after* this change will be encrypted for all GPG IDs listed in the root `.gpg-id` file.
*   **Existing Passwords:** Existing passwords are **not automatically re-encrypted**. To make an existing password accessible to the new recipient, you must edit and save it, or use a re-encryption script (see below).
    ```bash
    pass edit path/to/existing_password
    # Make a trivial change or no change, then save. pass will re-encrypt
    # it using all GPG IDs currently configured for its path.
    ```

## 4. Sharing Only a Specific Subfolder

This is often the preferred method for more granular control.

1.  **Create the subfolder if it doesn't exist:**
    ```bash
    # Example: creating a folder 'SharedWithFamily'
    mkdir -p ~/.password-store/SharedWithFamily
    ```

2.  **Create or edit a `.gpg-id` file *inside that subfolder*:**
    ```bash
    nano ~/.password-store/SharedWithFamily/.gpg-id
    ```
3.  Add your GPG ID and the GPG ID(s) of the people you want to share this folder with.
    Example content of `~/.password-store/SharedWithFamily/.gpg-id`:
    ```
    YOUR_GPG_ENCRYPTION_SUBKEY_ID
    RECIPIENT1_GPG_ID
    RECIPIENT2_GPG_ID
    ```
4.  Save the file.
5.  Add any passwords you want to share into this folder (e.g., `pass insert SharedWithFamily/wifi_password`).
6.  Commit the changes:
    ```bash
    cd ~/.password-store
    git add SharedWithFamily/.gpg-id
    # If you added passwords, pass would have committed them already.
    # If you only added/modified the .gpg-id file for an existing folder:
    git commit -m "Configure SharedWithFamily folder for GPG IDs X, Y, Z"
    pass git push
    ```

**Effect:**
*   Passwords created or edited *within* `SharedWithFamily` (or its subfolders, unless they have their own `.gpg-id`) will be encrypted for the GPG IDs listed in `SharedWithFamily/.gpg-id`.
*   Passwords outside this folder will continue to use the root `.gpg-id` (or other applicable subfolder `.gpg-id` files).

## 5. Re-encrypting Existing Passwords

When you add a new GPG ID to a `.gpg-id` file, `pass` does not automatically re-encrypt passwords already encrypted for a different set of keys.

*   **Manual Re-encryption (Password by Password):**
    ```bash
    pass edit path/to/password_to_share
    ```
    Save and close the editor (even without making changes). `pass` will re-encrypt it using the GPG IDs currently applicable to its path. This is the safest and simplest method for a few passwords.

*   **Scripting Re-encryption (Advanced):**
    For many passwords, manual editing is tedious. You can script this, but be careful.
    The `pass-import-keys` or `pass-reencrypt-gpg` scripts from the `pass-extension-audit` or similar community extensions can help.
    Alternatively, a simple loop:
    ```bash
    # WARNING: Test this carefully on a backup first!
    # This example assumes you want to re-encrypt everything in the store.
    # Adjust the 'find' command for specific subfolders.
    cd ~/.password-store
    find . -type f -name "*.gpg" -print0 | while IFS= read -r -d $'\0' gpgfile; do
        # Convert .gpg path to pass entry name
        entryname="${gpgfile%.gpg}"   # Remove .gpg suffix
        entryname="${entryname#./}"   # Remove leading ./
        echo "Re-encrypting: $entryname"
        pass edit "$entryname" # This will open $EDITOR, just save & quit
                               # Or, if you're sure and $EDITOR is non-interactive
                               # (like `echo` for a no-op if pass handles it):
                               # EDITOR=true pass edit "$entryname" # Highly dependent on pass version
    done
    git commit -m "Re-encrypt passwords for new GPG ID configuration"
    pass git push
    ```
    A safer way for programmatic re-encryption without opening an editor is to extract the password and re-insert it:
    ```bash
    # Again, test carefully!
    # entryname is path/to/password
    password_content=$(pass show "$entryname") # This gets the full content
    # If the first line is the password and others are metadata:
    # first_line_password=$(echo "$password_content" | head -n 1)
    # pass insert -f "$entryname" <<< "$first_line_password" # This only saves the first line
    # To save all lines, use multiline insert:
    pass insert -f -m "$entryname" <<< "$password_content"
    ```
    This ensures it uses the current `.gpg-id` settings for that path.

## 6. Recipient's Side

Once you've pushed the changes (updated `.gpg-id` and any re-encrypted passwords):
1.  The recipient needs to have `pass` and `git` installed.
2.  They need their own GPG private key (corresponding to the public key ID you added) in their GPG keyring.
3.  They clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone YOUR_SERVER_GIT_USER@YOUR_SERVER_HOSTNAME_OR_IP:YOUR_GIT_REPO_PATH_ON_SERVER ~/.password-store
    ```
4.  They should then be able to use `pass show path/to/shared_password` and be prompted for *their* GPG passphrase to decrypt it.

Sharing passwords with `pass` is powerful but requires careful management of GPG keys and understanding which `.gpg-id` file applies to which passwords. Always commit and push `.gpg-id` changes.
