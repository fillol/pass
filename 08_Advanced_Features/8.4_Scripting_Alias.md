# ‚ú® Scripting and Useful Aliases

**Page Objective:** This page provides ideas and examples for creating custom shell scripts or aliases to automate common `pass` tasks, streamline workflows, or integrate `pass` with other tools.

The command-line nature of `pass` makes it highly scriptable, allowing you to extend its functionality to fit your specific needs.

## 1. Shell Aliases for Common Operations

Aliases in your shell's configuration file (e.g., `~/.bashrc` for Bash, `~/.zshrc` for Zsh) can save typing and combine commands.

**Remember to `source ~/.bashrc` or `source ~/.zshrc` after adding aliases, or open a new terminal.**

```bash
# Shorten 'pass'
alias p='pass'

# Show and copy (default behavior of 'pass <entry>')
alias ps='pass'

# Only copy to clipboard
alias pc='pass -c'

# Generate a password (e.g., pgen Web/mysite 20)
alias pgen='pass generate'

# Edit an entry
alias pe='pass edit'

# Insert a new entry
alias pi='pass insert'

# List entries
alias pl='pass ls'

# Find entries
alias pf='pass find'

# Full sync: pull with rebase, then push
alias pass-sync='echo "Syncing password store..."; pass git pull --rebase && pass git push && echo "Sync complete."'

# Copy OTP code
alias potp='pass otp -c'

# Show password content in terminal (less secure, use with caution)
alias pshow='PASSWORD_STORE_X_SELECTION= principale pass show' # Forces to stdout if xclip/wl-copy installed
# A simpler way to force show might be to temporarily unset CLIP_TIME or use specific pass options if available.
# Alternatively, for a specific entry if you just want to see its decrypted content:
# show_pass_content() {
#   gpg --decrypt ~/.password-store/"$1".gpg
# }
# alias pcat='show_pass_content' # Usage: pcat path/to/entry (without .gpg)
```

## 2. Simple Scripts

For more complex logic, a small shell script can be useful. Store these scripts in a directory in your `$PATH` (e.g., `~/.local/bin` or `~/bin`). Remember to make them executable (`chmod +x your_script_name`).

### Example: Quickly Add Password and OTP

This script prompts for a password and then immediately for an OTP secret.
File: `~/bin/pass-add-plus-otp`
```bash
#!/bin.bash
# Script to add a password and then prompt for OTP

set -e # Exit on error

if [ -z "$1" ]; then
    echo "Usage: $0 <pass-entry-path>"
    exit 1
fi

ENTRY_PATH="$1"

# Add password
pass insert "$ENTRY_PATH"

# Add OTP
echo "" # Newline for clarity
echo "Now add OTP for $ENTRY_PATH (leave secret blank if none)"
pass otp insert "$ENTRY_PATH"

echo ""
echo "Entry $ENTRY_PATH created with password and potentially OTP."
echo "Remember to 'pass git push' to sync."
```
Make it executable: `chmod +x ~/bin/pass-add-plus-otp`
Usage: `pass-add-plus-otp Web/mynewservice`

### Example: Search Passwords and Copy Chosen One

A script using `fzf` (fuzzy finder) to select and copy a password.
Requires `fzf` to be installed: `sudo pacman -S fzf`
File: `~/bin/passfzf`
```bash
#!/bin.bash
# Fuzzy find and copy a password using fzf

set -e

# Get all password entries, remove .gpg extension and leading ./
# Store in a temporary file to handle spaces in names correctly with fzf
TMP_ENTRIES=$(mktemp)
trap 'rm -f "$TMP_ENTRIES"' EXIT # Ensure temp file is deleted

find "${PASSWORD_STORE_DIR:-$HOME/.password-store}" -type f -name "*.gpg" -print0 | \
    while IFS= read -r -d $'\0' gpgfile; do
        entryname="${gpgfile%.gpg}"
        entryname="${entryname#${PASSWORD_STORE_DIR:-$HOME/.password-store}/}"
        echo "$entryname" >> "$TMP_ENTRIES"
    done

# Use fzf to select an entry
SELECTED_ENTRY=$(sort "$TMP_ENTRIES" | fzf --height 40% --reverse --prompt="Select password: ")

if [ -n "$SELECTED_ENTRY" ]; then
    pass -c "$SELECTED_ENTRY"
    echo "Password for '$SELECTED_ENTRY' copied to clipboard."
else
    echo "No password selected."
fi
```
Make it executable: `chmod +x ~/bin/passfzf`
Usage: `passfzf`

## 3. Integrating with Other Tools

*   **Menu Systems (dmenu, rofi):**
    Similar to `fzf`, you can pipe `pass ls` output to `dmenu` or `rofi` to select a password and then use `pass -c` on the selection.
    Example `rofi` script snippet:
    ```bash
    # chosen=$(find "${PASSWORD_STORE_DIR:-$HOME/.password-store}" ... | rofi -dmenu -p "Pass")
    # if [ -n "$chosen" ]; then pass -c "$chosen"; fi
    ```

*   **SSH Authentication with GPG Agent:**
    While not directly `pass` scripting, if you have an Authentication GPG subkey, you can configure your SSH client to use `gpg-agent` as an SSH agent. This keeps your SSH private keys managed by GPG.
    In `~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf`:
    ```
    enable-ssh-support
    ```
    Add your GPG authentication keygrip to `~/.gnupg/sshcontrol`.
    Set `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` environment variable to point to `gpg-agent`'s socket:
    `export SSH_AUTH_SOCK=$(gpgconf --list-dirs agent-ssh-socket)` (add to `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`).

*   **Backups:**
    You can script backups of `~/.password-store` (though `git push` to your server is a primary sync/backup) and, more importantly, your GPG keys.
    ```bash
    #!/bin.bash
    # Simple GPG key backup script
    GPG_ID="YOUR_GPG_MASTER_KEY_ID_OR_EMAIL"
    BACKUP_DIR="$HOME/backups/gpg"
    DATE=$(date +"%Y-%m-%d")

    mkdir -p "$BACKUP_DIR"
    echo "Backing up GPG public key..."
    gpg --export --armor "$GPG_ID" > "$BACKUP_DIR/gpg_public_key_$DATE.asc"
    echo "Backing up GPG secret keys (CRITICAL!)..."
    gpg --export-secret-keys --armor "$GPG_ID" > "$BACKUP_DIR/gpg_secret_keys_CRITICAL_$DATE.asc"
    echo "Backing up GPG ownertrust..."
    gpg --export-ownertrust > "$BACKUP_DIR/gpg_ownertrust_$DATE.txt"
    echo "GPG backup complete in $BACKUP_DIR. SECURE THESE FILES!"
    ```

## 4. Using `pass` Output in Scripts

Since `pass <entry>` prints the password to stdout (and `pass show <entry>` also does), you can capture this in scripts. **Be extremely careful with this, as it involves handling decrypted passwords in memory or variables.**

```bash
# --- DANGEROUS EXAMPLE - USE WITH EXTREME CAUTION ---
# #!/bin/bash
# # Example: Log into a service that takes password via stdin
# SERVICE_PASS_ENTRY="Service/my_service_login"
#
# if pass_output=$(pass "$SERVICE_PASS_ENTRY" 2>/dev/null); then
#   # Extract first line as password
#   password=$(echo "$pass_output" | head -n 1)
#   # Now use the $password variable - ensure it's not echoed or logged
#   echo "$password" | some_command_expecting_password_on_stdin
# else
#   echo "Failed to retrieve password for $SERVICE_PASS_ENTRY"
# fi
# # --- END DANGEROUS EXAMPLE ---
```
For most use cases, relying on `pass -c` and manual pasting, or browser/application integrations, is more secure than scripting direct password handling.

The possibilities for scripting `pass` are extensive. Start with simple aliases and build up complexity as needed, always keeping security in mind.
