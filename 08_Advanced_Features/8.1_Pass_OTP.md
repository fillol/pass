# ‚ú® Managing TOTP Codes with `pass-otp`

**Page Objective:** This page explains how to install and use the `pass-otp` extension to store Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP) secrets within your `pass` store and generate 2FA codes.

Integrating TOTP management into `pass` allows you to keep your passwords and second-factor secrets together, encrypted under your GPG key. Compatible clients like `Android Password Store (APS)` and `qtpass` can also display these OTP codes.

## 1. What is `pass-otp`?

`pass-otp` is a `pass` extension that allows you to:
*   Store the TOTP secret key (often provided as a QR code or a string of characters by services when setting up 2FA) in an encrypted file alongside the main password.
*   Generate the current 6 or 8-digit TOTP code based on this secret and the current time.

It typically stores the OTP secret as an `otpauth://` URI within the password file.

## 2. Installation on Arch Linux

You should have already installed `pass-otp` and its dependency `oathtool` in [Section 5.1](../05_Arch_Linux_Client_Setup/5.1_Installing_Pass.md). If not, install them now:
```bash
sudo pacman -S pass-otp oathtool
```
`oathtool` is a command-line utility used by `pass-otp` to actually generate the codes.

## 3. Adding an OTP Secret to a `pass` Entry

When you set up 2FA for a service, it will provide you with a secret key. This is often displayed as a QR code (which contains an `otpauth://` URI) and also as a plain text string.

Let's say you have a password entry `Web/myservice.com`.

1.  **Obtain the `otpauth://` URI:**
    *   **Using QR Code:** If you can, scan the QR code with a generic QR scanner app. The decoded text will be the `otpauth://` URI. It looks something like:
        `otpauth://totp/MyService:your_username?secret=JBSWY3DPEHPK3PXP&issuer=MyService`
    *   **Using Secret Key String:** If the service only gives you the secret key string (e.g., `JBSWY3DPEHPK3PXP`), you can construct the URI or let `pass otp insert` prompt you.

2.  **Use `pass otp insert`:**
    *   **If you have the full `otpauth://` URI:**
        ```bash
        pass otp insert Web/myservice.com "otpauth://totp/MyService:your_username?secret=JBSWY3DPEHPK3PXP&issuer=MyService"
        ```
        Enclose the URI in quotes. `pass otp` will append this URI as a new line to your existing `Web/myservice.com.gpg` file.

    *   **If you only have the secret key string and want to be prompted:**
        ```bash
        pass otp insert Web/myservice.com
        ```
        `pass-otp` will then prompt you:
        ```
        Enter secret key for Web/myservice.com: YOUR_SECRET_KEY_STRING_HERE
        Enter account name for Web/myservice.com (your_username): your_actual_username
        Enter issuer for Web/myservice.com (MyService): NameOfService
        ```
        It will then construct and append the `otpauth://` URI.

`pass otp insert` will automatically `git add` and `git commit` the change to your password file. Remember to `pass git push` to sync this to your server.

## 4. Generating/Viewing an OTP Code

Once an OTP secret is stored, you can generate the current code:

*   **Generate and Copy to Clipboard (Default):**
    ```bash
    pass otp Web/myservice.com
    ```
    This will calculate the current TOTP code and copy it to your clipboard for a short period (respecting `PASSWORD_STORE_CLIP_TIME`).

*   **Generate and Print to Terminal:**
    If you want to see the code printed in the terminal (less secure if someone is shoulder-surfing):
    ```bash
    pass otp -p Web/myservice.com
    # or
    pass otp --print Web/myservice.com
    ```

*   **View the `otpauth://` URI (and other entry content):**
    To see the raw content of the password file, including the OTP URI:
    ```bash
    pass show Web/myservice.com
    # or
    pass Web/myservice.com
    ```
    (Note: `pass show` or `pass` without `-c` will print the *entire file content*, including the password and the OTP URI, then copy the *first line only* (password) to the clipboard. `pass otp` specifically handles the OTP part.)

## 5. Usage with `qtpass`

`qtpass` usually has built-in support for `pass-otp`.
1.  Select an entry in `qtpass` that has an `otpauth://` URI stored.
2.  `qtpass` should display the current TOTP code in a dedicated field or allow you to easily copy it. The code will typically refresh automatically.

## 6. Usage with Android Password Store (APS)

APS also has excellent built-in support for `pass-otp`.
1.  Ensure your Android device has synced the changes (the password file now containing the `otpauth://` URI).
2.  When you open the corresponding entry in APS, it will detect the OTP secret.
3.  APS will display the current, auto-refreshing TOTP code.
4.  You can usually tap the OTP code to copy it to the clipboard.

## 7. Modifying or Deleting an OTP Secret

To modify or delete an OTP secret, you'll need to edit the password file directly:
1.  ```bash
    pass edit Web/myservice.com
    ```
2.  Your text editor will open with the decrypted content.
3.  Find the line starting with `otpauth://...`.
    *   To **modify**, change the URI (e.g., if the secret key changed).
    *   To **delete**, remove that entire line.
4.  Save and close the editor. `pass` will re-encrypt and commit the changes.

Managing TOTP codes with `pass-otp` centralizes your credential management securely and conveniently, especially when combined with compatible clients like APS and `qtpass`.
