# ‚ú® Browser Integration (passff, browserpass)

**Page Objective:** This page provides an overview and general setup instructions for integrating `pass` with your web browser using extensions like `passff` (for Firefox) or `browserpass` (for Chrome/Chromium and Firefox).

Browser integration allows you to automatically fill usernames, passwords, and even OTP codes from your `pass` store directly into web login forms, and sometimes to save new credentials back to `pass`.

## 1. How Browser Integration Works

Most `pass` browser extensions work on a similar principle:
1.  **Browser Extension:** You install an extension in your web browser.
2.  **Native Host Application (Helper Script):** The browser extension communicates with a small native application (often a Python or Go script, or a compiled binary) installed on your system.
3.  **Communication:** When you're on a login page, the extension can query the native host application.
4.  **Accessing `pass`:** The native host application invokes the `pass` command-line tool to search for matching entries, decrypt passwords/OTPs (prompting for your GPG passphrase via `gpg-agent` if needed), and then sends the credentials back to the browser extension to fill the form.

## 2. General Setup Steps

The exact steps vary slightly between extensions, but the general process is:

1.  **Install the Native Host Application** on your Arch Linux system.
2.  **Install the corresponding Browser Extension** from your browser's add-on store.
3.  **Configure the Extension** (if necessary) to correctly locate the native host application.
4.  **Test** on a login page.

**Important for Wayland:**
Ensure your native host application and the way it interacts with `pass` (especially for clipboard operations if it uses them as an intermediary) are compatible with Wayland. Most modern solutions handle this well by directly interfacing with `pass` or using `wl-clipboard` if needed.

## 3. `browserpass` (Chrome/Chromium & Firefox)

`browserpass` is a popular choice that supports both major browser families.

### A. Install Native Host Application for `browserpass`

On Arch Linux, `browserpass` is typically available in the official repositories or the AUR.
```bash
# For Chromium/Chrome
sudo pacman -S browserpass-chromium

# For Firefox
sudo pacman -S browserpass-firefox

# There might also be a generic 'browserpass' package that installs the host
# and then you tell the specific browser extension where to find it.
# Check Arch Wiki or package details for the most current recommendation.
# If not in official repos, use an AUR helper like yay:
# yay -S browserpass
```
The package will install the native host application (often a Go binary) and JSON manifest files that tell the browser where to find it.

### B. Install `browserpass` Browser Extension

1.  **For Chrome/Chromium:** Go to the Chrome Web Store and search for "Browserpass". Install the official extension.
2.  **For Firefox:** Go to the Firefox Add-ons (AMO) site and search for "Browserpass". Install the official extension.

### C. Configure and Use `browserpass`

*   After installation, the browser extension should automatically detect the native host.
*   Click the Browserpass icon in your browser's toolbar when on a login page.
*   It will search your `pass` store for entries matching the current domain.
*   Select an entry to fill the username and password.
*   It can often also fill TOTP codes if you use `pass-otp`.
*   You might be prompted for your GPG passphrase by `pinentry` if it's not cached.

## 4. `passff` (Firefox)

`passff` is another excellent option, specifically for Firefox.

### A. Install Native Host Application for `passff`

On Arch Linux, the `passff-host` application is usually available.
```bash
sudo pacman -S passff-host
# Or from AUR if not in official repos, or for a -git version:
# yay -S passff-host-git
```
This installs the host script and the necessary manifest file for Firefox.

### B. Install `passff` Browser Extension

1.  Go to the Firefox Add-ons (AMO) site and search for "PassFF".
2.  Install the official extension.

### C. Configure and Use `passff`

1.  **Configuration:**
    *   After installing both, you might need to check PassFF's preferences in Firefox (Tools -> Add-ons and Themes -> Extensions -> PassFF -> Preferences).
    *   Ensure the path to `pass` is correct (usually auto-detected).
    *   Configure other preferences like automatic form submission, OTP handling, etc.

2.  **Usage:**
    *   Right-click on a username or password field on a webpage, or click the PassFF toolbar icon.
    *   A menu will appear showing matching entries from your `pass` store.
    *   Select an entry to fill credentials.
    *   PassFF also supports `pass-otp` for filling TOTP codes.
    *   It can also help you save new credentials to `pass`.

## 5. Security Considerations

*   **Trust:** You are trusting the browser extension and the native host application to handle your GPG passphrase prompts (via `gpg-agent`) and decrypted passwords. Use official extensions from trusted sources.
*   **Native Host Permissions:** The native host application needs permission to execute `pass` (and `gpg`).
*   **Browser Security:** Keep your browser updated. Malicious browser extensions could potentially interfere, though the GPG decryption itself happens outside the browser's direct control.

## Troubleshooting

*   **Extension cannot connect to native host:**
    *   Ensure the native host application is installed correctly.
    *   Check if the browser can find the manifest file (this is usually handled by the package manager).
    *   Restart your browser.
    *   Check the extension's debugging options or browser console for errors.
    *   Ensure no other software (like AppArmor or SELinux, though less common on typical Arch desktop installs unless specifically configured) is blocking communication.

*   **No passwords found / GPG errors:**
    *   Test `pass` from the command line to ensure it's working correctly.
    *   Make sure `gpg-agent` and `pinentry` are functioning.
    *   The native host script must be running with the correct environment to find `gpg`, `pass`, etc. This is usually handled if installed via pacman.

Browser integration significantly speeds up logging into websites. Choose the extension that best fits your browser and workflow.
