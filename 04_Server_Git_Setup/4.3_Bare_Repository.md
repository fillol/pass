# ‚òÅÔ∏è Creating the Bare Git Repository

**Page Objective:** This page details how to create a "bare" Git repository on your server, which will store your encrypted `pass` data.

A bare Git repository is a special type of repository that doesn't have a working directory (no checked-out files). It only contains the Git version history and metadata. This is the standard way to set up a central repository for sharing and collaboration or, in this case, synchronization between your devices.

## 1. Decide on the Repository Location

You need to choose a directory on your server where the bare repository will live.
*   **Common choices:**
    *   `/srv/git/your-repo-name.git`
    *   `/var/git/your-repo-name.git`
    *   `/opt/git/your-repo-name.git`
    *   `/home/YOUR_SERVER_GIT_USER/your-repo-name.git` (if you want it within the dedicated user's home directory, which is a simple and secure option if the user is solely for this purpose)

For this guide, we'll use `password-store.git` as the repository name. Let's assume we'll place it in the home directory of `YOUR_SERVER_GIT_USER` for simplicity and to ensure the user has ownership.
So, the full path will be `YOUR_GIT_REPO_PATH_ON_SERVER`, which we'll define as `/home/YOUR_SERVER_GIT_USER/password-store.git`.

**Important:** The `YOUR_SERVER_GIT_USER` (created in the previous step) must have write permissions to this directory. If you choose a location outside the user's home directory (like `/srv/git/`), ensure `YOUR_SERVER_GIT_USER` owns or has write access to the parent directory where the `.git` folder will be created.

## 2. Create the Repository Directory and Initialize

Connect to your server via SSH if you haven't already. It's best to perform these actions as `YOUR_SERVER_GIT_USER` to ensure correct ownership from the start.

1.  **Switch to `YOUR_SERVER_GIT_USER`:**
    ```bash
    sudo su - YOUR_SERVER_GIT_USER
    ```
    You will be in the home directory of `YOUR_SERVER_GIT_USER` (e.g., `/home/YOUR_SERVER_GIT_USER/`).

2.  **Create the repository directory:**
    We decided on `YOUR_GIT_REPO_PATH_ON_SERVER` being `/home/YOUR_SERVER_GIT_USER/password-store.git`.
    ```bash
    # This command creates 'password-store.git' in the current directory (home directory)
    mkdir password-store.git
    ```

3.  **Navigate into the repository directory:**
    ```bash
    cd password-store.git
    ```

4.  **Initialize the bare repository:**
    ```bash
    git init --bare
    ```
    This command creates the necessary Git files and directories (e.g., `objects`, `refs`, `HEAD`) inside the `password-store.git` directory. You should see output similar to:
    `Initialized empty Git repository in /home/YOUR_SERVER_GIT_USER/password-store.git/`

5.  **(Optional) Verify directory contents:**
    You can list the contents to see the bare repository structure:
    ```bash
    ls -la
    ```
    You'll see files like `HEAD`, `config`, `description`, and directories like `hooks`, `info`, `objects`, `refs`.

6.  **Exit from `YOUR_SERVER_GIT_USER` shell if you switched:**
    ```bash
    exit
    ```

### Alternative: Choosing a Location Outside User's Home (e.g., `/srv/git/`)

If you chose a location like `/srv/git/password-store.git`:

1.  **Create the parent directory and set ownership (as root/sudo):**
    ```bash
    sudo mkdir -p /srv/git
    # Ensure YOUR_SERVER_GIT_USER can write here.
    # The simplest is to make YOUR_SERVER_GIT_USER the owner:
    sudo chown YOUR_SERVER_GIT_USER:YOUR_SERVER_GIT_USER /srv/git
    sudo chmod 700 /srv/git # Or 750, 770 depending on group needs
    ```
2.  **Then, as `YOUR_SERVER_GIT_USER` (after `sudo su - YOUR_SERVER_GIT_USER`):**
    ```bash
    cd /srv/git
    mkdir password-store.git
    cd password-store.git
    git init --bare
    exit
    ```
    In this case, `YOUR_GIT_REPO_PATH_ON_SERVER` would be `/srv/git/password-store.git`.

Your bare Git repository is now set up on the server. The Git repository URL your clients will use will be structured as:
`YOUR_SERVER_GIT_USER@YOUR_SERVER_HOSTNAME_OR_IP:PATH_TO_REPO`

*   If the repo is in the user's home (e.g., `/home/YOUR_SERVER_GIT_USER/password-store.git`), the path part of the URL can often be relative to the home directory:
    `YOUR_SERVER_GIT_USER@YOUR_SERVER_HOSTNAME_OR_IP:password-store.git`
*   If the repo is in an absolute path like `/srv/git/password-store.git`, you must use the absolute path (preceded by a colon):
    `YOUR_SERVER_GIT_USER@YOUR_SERVER_HOSTNAME_OR_IP:/srv/git/password-store.git`

The next step is to configure SSH access so your clients can securely connect to it.
