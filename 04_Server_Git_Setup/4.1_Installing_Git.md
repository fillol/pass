# ‚òÅÔ∏è Installing Git on the Server

**Page Objective:** This page provides instructions for installing the Git version control system on your Linux server.

Git is the backbone for versioning and synchronizing your `pass` password store. If it's not already installed on your server, follow these steps.

## 1. Connect to Your Server

First, connect to your server via SSH:
```bash
ssh your_ssh_user@YOUR_SERVER_HOSTNAME_OR_IP
```
Replace `your_ssh_user` with your regular user account that has `sudo` privileges on the server, and `YOUR_SERVER_HOSTNAME_OR_IP` with your server's actual address.

## 2. Update Package Lists

It's always a good practice to update your server's package lists before installing new software.

*   **For Debian/Ubuntu based systems:**
    ```bash
    sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
    ```

*   **For Fedora/RHEL based systems:**
    ```bash
    sudo dnf check-update && sudo dnf upgrade
    ```
    (Older RHEL/CentOS versions might use `yum upgrade`)

*   **For Arch Linux based systems:**
    ```bash
    sudo pacman -Syu
    ```

## 3. Install Git

Now, install Git using your server's package manager.

*   **For Debian/Ubuntu based systems (e.g., Ubuntu Server, Debian, Raspberry Pi OS):**
    ```bash
    sudo apt install git
    ```

*   **For Fedora/RHEL based systems (e.g., Fedora Server, CentOS, AlmaLinux):**
    ```bash
    sudo dnf install git
    ```
    (Older RHEL/CentOS versions might use `yum install git`)

*   **For Arch Linux based systems:**
    ```bash
    sudo pacman -S git
    ```

## 4. Verify Installation

Once the installation is complete, verify that Git is installed correctly and check its version:
```bash
git --version
```
This command should output the installed Git version, for example: `git version 2.34.1`.

With Git installed on your server, you are ready to proceed with creating a dedicated user for managing your password store repository.
