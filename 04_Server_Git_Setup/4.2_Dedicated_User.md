# ‚òÅÔ∏è Creating a Dedicated User (Recommended)

**Page Objective:** This page explains why and how to create a dedicated, unprivileged user account on your server specifically for Git operations related to your `pass` password store.

Using a dedicated user for your Git repository enhances security by limiting potential damage if the account were ever compromised. This user will own the Git repository and will be the one your clients connect to via SSH.

## 1. Why a Dedicated User?

*   **Principle of Least Privilege:** The dedicated user will only have permissions necessary for Git operations, not general system access.
*   **Isolation:** Keeps your `pass` Git repository separate from other users and services on the server.
*   **Easier Auditing:** Simpler to track actions related to the password store.

## 2. Create the New User

Connect to your server via SSH if you haven't already. Use a user with `sudo` privileges.
Replace `YOUR_SERVER_GIT_USER` with the username you want to create (e.g., `gitpass`, `passgit`, or simply `git` if it's not already in use for other system purposes).

```bash
sudo adduser YOUR_SERVER_GIT_USER
```
You will be prompted to set a password for this new user and provide some optional information.
*   **Password:** Set a strong, unique password. However, for enhanced security, we will aim to use SSH key-based authentication for this user and potentially disable password authentication for it later (covered in [Section 4.4](./4.4_Configuring_SSH_Access.md) and [Section 9.3](../09_Maintenance_Security/9.3_Server_Security.md)).

## 3. (Optional but Highly Recommended) Restrict User's Shell to `git-shell`

If this user account (`YOUR_SERVER_GIT_USER`) will *only* be used for Git push/pull operations via SSH and not for interactive logins, you can restrict its shell to `git-shell`. This prevents the user from logging into a regular shell environment, significantly limiting what they can do on the server.

1.  **Check if `git-shell` is available and its path:**
    `git-shell` is typically included with Git installations. Find its path:
    ```bash
    which git-shell
    ```
    Common paths include `/usr/bin/git-shell` or `/usr/local/bin/git-shell`. Note this path.

2.  **Ensure `git-shell` is listed in `/etc/shells`:**
    For a shell to be assignable to a user, it usually needs to be listed in the `/etc/shells` file. Open the file with a text editor (e.g., `sudo nano /etc/shells`) and add the path to `git-shell` (found in the previous step) if it's not already there. For example, if `which git-shell` returned `/usr/bin/git-shell`, ensure this line exists in `/etc/shells`:
    ```
    /usr/bin/git-shell
    ```
    Save and close the file.

3.  **Change the user's login shell:**
    Replace `/usr/bin/git-shell` with the actual path you noted from `which git-shell`.
    ```bash
    sudo usermod -s /usr/bin/git-shell YOUR_SERVER_GIT_USER
    ```

If you restrict the shell to `git-shell`, this user will only be able to perform Git-related commands when connecting via SSH. They won't get a normal command prompt.

## 4. (Advanced/Optional) Create `git-shell-commands` Directory

If you've set the shell to `git-shell`, you can optionally create a directory named `git-shell-commands` in the home directory of `YOUR_SERVER_GIT_USER`. Any executable scripts placed here can be run by the user before `git-shell` processes the Git command (e.g., for logging or custom access control). This is an advanced feature and not strictly necessary for a basic `pass` setup.

If you wish to create it:
```bash
# As root or user with sudo:
sudo mkdir /home/YOUR_SERVER_GIT_USER/git-shell-commands
sudo chown YOUR_SERVER_GIT_USER:YOUR_SERVER_GIT_USER /home/YOUR_SERVER_GIT_USER/git-shell-commands
sudo chmod 750 /home/YOUR_SERVER_GIT_USER/git-shell-commands # Example permissions
```
Or, as `YOUR_SERVER_GIT_USER`:
```bash
# After 'sudo su - YOUR_SERVER_GIT_USER'
mkdir ~/git-shell-commands
chmod 750 ~/git-shell-commands
# exit
```

You have now created a dedicated user for managing your Git repository. The next step is to create the bare Git repository itself, which this user will own.
