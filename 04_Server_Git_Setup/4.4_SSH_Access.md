# ‚òÅÔ∏è Configuring SSH Access for Clients

**Page Objective:** This page explains how to set up SSH key-based authentication, allowing your `pass` clients (desktop, Android) to securely connect to your self-hosted Git server without using passwords.

SSH key-based authentication is more secure and convenient than password-based authentication for automated processes like Git synchronization with your `pass` repository.

## 1. Understanding SSH Key-Based Authentication

SSH key-based authentication involves:
*   **A Key Pair:** Generated on each client device. This pair consists of:
    *   A **private key**: Kept secret and secure on the client machine.
    *   A **public key**: Copied to the server and added to a list of authorized keys for a specific user.
*   **Authentication Process:** When a client attempts to connect, the server issues a challenge that can only be correctly answered if the client possesses the corresponding private key.

This method avoids sending passwords over the network and is ideal for programmatic access.

## 2. On Each Client Device That Will Access the Git Server

These steps need to be performed on **each client machine** (your Arch Linux desktop, any other computers) and conceptually for your **Android device** (where OpenKeychain will manage the keys).

### A. Generating/Identifying SSH Keys on a Desktop Client (e.g., Arch Linux)

1.  **Check for Existing SSH Keys:**
    Open a terminal on your client machine. Look for existing public keys:
    ```bash
    ls -al ~/.ssh/id_*.pub
    ```
    If files like `id_rsa.pub`, `id_ed25519.pub`, or `id_ecdsa.pub` exist, you likely already have an SSH key pair. You can reuse an existing key or create a new one specifically for accessing your `pass` Git server. Using a dedicated key can be a good practice for better organization or security compartmentalization.

2.  **Generate a New SSH Key Pair (If Needed or Preferred):**
    The `ed25519` algorithm is a modern, secure, and efficient choice.
    ```bash
    # To generate a default key (if one doesn't exist or you want to overwrite):
    # ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com_desktop_pass_client"

    # To generate a new, specifically named key (recommended for clarity):
    # Replace YOUR_CLIENT_SSH_KEY_PATH with your desired path, e.g., ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_pass_server
    ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f YOUR_CLIENT_SSH_KEY_PATH -C "your_email@example.com_desktop_pass_client"
    ```
    *   When prompted for a file to save the key, confirm the path (e.g., `~/.ssh/id_ed25519_pass_server`).
    *   You will be prompted to enter a **passphrase**. Using a strong passphrase to encrypt your private key on disk is **highly recommended**. You'll need to enter this passphrase when the key is first used by an application, unless you use an SSH agent to cache it.

3.  **Retrieve the Public Key Content:**
    The public key file will have the same name as the private key but with a `.pub` extension.
    If you saved your key as `YOUR_CLIENT_SSH_KEY_PATH` (e.g., `~/.ssh/id_ed25519_pass_server`), the public key is `YOUR_CLIENT_SSH_KEY_PATH.pub`.
    ```bash
    cat YOUR_CLIENT_SSH_KEY_PATH.pub
    ```
    Copy the entire output of this command. It will be a single long line, typically starting with `ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3...` followed by your comment. This is the public key string you need to add to your server.

### B. SSH Key for Android Client (Managed by OpenKeychain)

For your Android device, **Android Password Store (APS)** will rely on **OpenKeychain** to handle SSH connections and keys.

1.  **Install OpenKeychain** on your Android device if you haven't already.
2.  Open OpenKeychain.
3.  Navigate to the section for managing SSH keys. This might be under a general "Keys" menu, then selecting a GPG key and finding an SSH option, or a dedicated "Manage SSH Identities" area.
4.  You can typically:
    *   **Generate a new SSH key pair** directly within OpenKeychain.
    *   **Use an existing GPG Authentication subkey (`[A]`)** for SSH, if you have one and OpenKeychain supports this association.
5.  Once an SSH identity is active in OpenKeychain, find an option to **"Share public key"** or **"Export public SSH key"**.
6.  Copy this public SSH key string (e.g., by emailing it to yourself or copying it to a shared note).

## 3. Adding Client Public Keys to the Server

On your server, you need to add each client's public SSH key to the `authorized_keys` file within the `.ssh` directory of `YOUR_SERVER_GIT_USER`.

1.  **Connect to your server via SSH** using an account with `sudo` privileges if `YOUR_SERVER_GIT_USER` cannot log in directly yet or if you need to create its `.ssh` directory.
    ```bash
    ssh your_regular_sudo_user@YOUR_SERVER_HOSTNAME_OR_IP
    ```

2.  **Switch to `YOUR_SERVER_GIT_USER` or prepare to edit its files as root/sudo.**
    The cleanest way is often to perform these steps as `YOUR_SERVER_GIT_USER`.
    ```bash
    sudo su - YOUR_SERVER_GIT_USER
    ```

3.  **Ensure the `.ssh` directory exists and has correct permissions:**
    ```bash
    mkdir -p ~/.ssh
    chmod 700 ~/.ssh
    ```
    The `~/.ssh` directory permissions **must be `700`** (drwx------), meaning only the owner can read, write, and execute. SSH will refuse key authentication if these permissions are too open.

4.  **Create or append to the `authorized_keys` file and set its permissions:**
    ```bash
    touch ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
    chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
    ```
    The `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file permissions **must be `600`** (-rw-------), meaning only the owner can read and write.

5.  **Add a Client's Public Key:**
    Open `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` with a text editor (e.g., `nano ~/.ssh/authorized_keys`).
    Paste the public SSH key string (copied from the client in step 2A or 2B) onto a **new line** in this file. Each public key must be on its own separate line.
    Save and close the file.

    **Repeat this step for each client device (each desktop, and the key from OpenKeychain for Android).**

6.  If you switched user with `sudo su - YOUR_SERVER_GIT_USER`, exit back:
    ```bash
    exit
    ```

**Alternative using `ssh-copy-id` (from Desktop Client):**
If `YOUR_SERVER_GIT_USER` can temporarily accept password logins, or if your `sudo` user can directly SSH as `YOUR_SERVER_GIT_USER` using another method, you can use `ssh-copy-id` from your desktop client:
```bash
# On your DESKTOP CLIENT:
# Replace YOUR_CLIENT_SSH_KEY_PATH.pub with your actual public key file
ssh-copy-id -i YOUR_CLIENT_SSH_KEY_PATH.pub YOUR_SERVER_GIT_USER@YOUR_SERVER_HOSTNAME_OR_IP
```
This utility automatically creates the `.ssh` directory and `authorized_keys` file with the correct permissions on the server and appends the key.

## 4. Test SSH Connection from a Desktop Client

From one of your desktop client machines where you've set up an SSH key:
```bash
# If using a default key (e.g., ~/.ssh/id_ed25519):
ssh YOUR_SERVER_GIT_USER@YOUR_SERVER_HOSTNAME_OR_IP

# If using a specifically named key:
# Replace YOUR_CLIENT_SSH_KEY_PATH with the path to your private key
ssh -i YOUR_CLIENT_SSH_KEY_PATH YOUR_SERVER_GIT_USER@YOUR_SERVER_HOSTNAME_OR_IP
```
*   **Expected Behavior with `git-shell`:** If you configured `YOUR_SERVER_GIT_USER` with `git-shell`, you should *not* get a normal login prompt. Instead, you might see a message like `PTY allocation request failed on channel 0`, a list of available commands (if `git-shell-commands` is set up), or simply `Connection to YOUR_SERVER_HOSTNAME_OR_IP closed.` This indicates successful authentication but no interactive shell. This is correct.
*   **Expected Behavior without `git-shell`:** If `YOUR_SERVER_GIT_USER` has a regular shell (e.g., `/bin/bash`), you should get a login prompt for that user.
*   **Failure:** If you are prompted for `YOUR_SERVER_GIT_USER`'s password, SSH key authentication has failed. Re-check:
    *   Permissions on `~/.ssh` (700) and `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` (600) on the server for `YOUR_SERVER_GIT_USER`.
    *   The exact content of the public key pasted into `authorized_keys`.
    *   Server's main SSH configuration (`/etc/ssh/sshd_config`) to ensure `PubkeyAuthentication yes` is set (it usually is by default).
    *   Firewall rules on the server (though if password auth works, SSH traffic is getting through).

## 5. (Recommended) Harden Server SSH Configuration

Consider disabling password authentication for `YOUR_SERVER_GIT_USER` on the server for better security, forcing the use of SSH keys. This is typically done in `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` using a `Match User` block. This will be covered in more detail in the [Server Security section (9.3)](../09_Maintenance_Security/9.3_Server_Security.md).

With SSH key access configured, your clients are now ready to securely communicate with your self-hosted Git repository for `pass`.
