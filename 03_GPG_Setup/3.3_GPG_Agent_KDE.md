# üîë Configuring `gpg-agent` on Arch Linux with KDE

**Page Objective:** This page explains how to configure `gpg-agent` on your Arch Linux system with KDE Plasma for convenient GPG passphrase caching and integration with KWallet, along with setting up a graphical pinentry program.

`gpg-agent` is a background daemon that caches your GPG passphrase so you don't have to enter it every time you use your GPG key (e.g., when `pass` decrypts a password). KDE Plasma can integrate with `gpg-agent` using `pinentry-qt` for graphical passphrase prompts and KWallet for securely storing the cached passphrase across sessions.

## 1. Install Necessary Packages

Ensure you have the required packages installed. Most of these are likely already installed if you have a standard KDE Plasma setup on Arch Linux.

*   **`gnupg`**: The GNU Privacy Guard suite (provides `gpg` and `gpg-agent`).
*   **`pinentry`**: GnuPG uses Pinentry programs to prompt for passphrases. For KDE, `pinentry-qt` is preferred.
*   **`kwalletmanager` (or `kwallet-pam` for auto-unlocking KWallet on login):** KDE's wallet management system.
*   **(Optional) `kgpg`**: A KDE GUI for GPG key management, which can sometimes help with agent configuration, though not strictly necessary for `pass`.

```bash
sudo pacman -S gnupg pinentry kwalletmanager
# If you want KWallet to auto-unlock with your login password (requires configuration):
# sudo pacman -S kwallet-pam
```
Usually, `pinentry` will install multiple versions (e.g., `pinentry-gtk-2`, `pinentry-qt`, `pinentry-curses`). We want to ensure `gpg-agent` uses `pinentry-qt`.

## 2. Configure `gpg-agent`

Create or edit the `gpg-agent` configuration file `~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf`.
```bash
nano ~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf
```
Add or ensure the following lines are present:
```ini
# Use the Qt pinentry program for graphical passphrase prompts in KDE
pinentry-program /usr/bin/pinentry-qt

# Cache passphrase for 10 minutes (600 seconds) after last use
default-cache-ttl 600

# Maximum time passphrase can be cached (2 hours = 7200 seconds)
max-cache-ttl 7200

# (Optional) Enable SSH agent support if you want gpg-agent to manage SSH keys too
# enable-ssh-support
# default-cache-ttl-ssh 600
# max-cache-ttl-ssh 7200
```
*   Verify the path `/usr/bin/pinentry-qt` is correct by running `which pinentry-qt`.
*   Adjust `default-cache-ttl` (Time To Live) and `max-cache-ttl` to your preference. `default-cache-ttl` resets if the key is used. `max-cache-ttl` is an absolute timeout.

## 3. Configure KWallet Integration (Recommended)

KDE Plasma can automatically start `gpg-agent` and integrate it with KWallet, so KWallet can store your GPG passphrase securely and provide it to `gpg-agent` when needed. This often means you only enter your GPG passphrase once per KWallet session (or never, if KWallet is auto-unlocked at login).

This integration is often handled by Plasma's startup scripts or systemd user services.

1.  **Ensure KWallet is Enabled and Working:**
    *   Open `kwalletmanager` from your application launcher.
    *   Make sure you have a wallet created (usually named `kdewallet`).
    *   If it's your first time, you'll be prompted to create one and set its password. It's common to use your login password for convenience, especially if using `kwallet-pam`.

2.  **GPG Agent Startup:**
    KDE Plasma usually takes care of starting `gpg-agent` correctly with the environment variables needed for applications to find it (like `GPG_AGENT_INFO`).

3.  **First Passphrase Prompt:**
    The first time an application (like `pass` or `qtpass`) needs your GPG key after `gpg-agent` starts (and the passphrase isn't cached or in KWallet yet):
    *   `pinentry-qt` should pop up a graphical dialog asking for your GPG passphrase.
    *   There should be an option in this dialog like **"Store password in KWallet"** or similar. **Check this box.**
    *   Enter your GPG passphrase.
    *   KWallet will then prompt for its password (if KWallet is not already open) to save the GPG passphrase.

Once stored in KWallet, `gpg-agent` should be able to retrieve it automatically in subsequent uses within the same KWallet session, meaning no more GPG passphrase prompts until KWallet is closed and locked, or the `gpg-agent` cache TTL expires.

## 4. Restart `gpg-agent` (or Reboot/Relogin)

For the new `gpg-agent.conf` settings to take effect, you need to restart `gpg-agent`. The easiest way to ensure everything is re-initialized correctly is to **log out and log back in** to your KDE Plasma session, or reboot.

Alternatively, you can try to kill and restart the agent manually (though relogin is often cleaner):
```bash
gpg-connect-agent killagent /bye
gpg-connect-agent /bye
# Or
# killall gpg-agent
# (gpg-agent should restart automatically on demand)
```
After relogin or restarting the agent, test it:
```bash
pass show some/existing/password # Or any gpg operation
```
You should get the `pinentry-qt` prompt, and if you choose to save it in KWallet, subsequent calls (within the TTL) should not prompt you.

## 5. (Optional) Using `gpg-agent` for SSH Authentication

If you enabled `enable-ssh-support` in `gpg-agent.conf` and have an GPG authentication subkey (`[A]`):
1.  Add your GPG authentication subkey's **keygrip** to `~/.gnupg/sshcontrol`.
    *   Find the keygrip: `gpg --with-keygrip -k YOUR_GPG_MASTER_KEY_ID_OR_EMAIL` (look for the `Keygrip = ...` line under your `[A]` subkey).
    *   `echo "YOUR_AUTH_SUBKEY_KEYGRIP_HERE" >> ~/.gnupg/sshcontrol`
2.  Set the `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` environment variable to point to `gpg-agent`'s SSH socket. Add this to your `~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, or `~/.config/plasma-workspace/env/ssh-agent.sh` (for Plasma to pick it up early):
    ```bash
    # In e.g. ~/.bashrc
    unset SSH_AGENT_PID
    if [ "${gnupg_SSH_AUTH_SOCK_by:-0}" -ne $$ ]; then
      export SSH_AUTH_SOCK="$(gpgconf --list-dirs agent-ssh-socket)"
    fi
    ```
    Or more simply, though the above is more robust against multiple sourcing:
    ```bash
    export SSH_AUTH_SOCK=$(gpgconf --list-dirs agent-ssh-socket)
    ```
    You'll need to source your shell config or relogin.
3.  Now, `ssh` commands should try to use keys managed by `gpg-agent`. You can add SSH private keys to `gpg-agent` using `ssh-add -L` to list (should show GPG key) or `ssh-add /path/to/private_ssh_key` to add standard SSH keys to be managed by `gpg-agent`.

This setup provides a smooth experience for `pass` and other GPG operations on KDE Plasma, minimizing repetitive passphrase entries while leveraging KWallet for secure caching.
