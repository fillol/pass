# 🔑 Secure GPG Key Backup & Revocation Certificate

**Page Objective:** This page details the critical steps for securely backing up your GPG private keys (especially the master key) and generating a revocation certificate. These actions are essential for disaster recovery and security.

Losing access to your GPG private key means losing access to all data encrypted with it (including your passwords in `pass`). A revocation certificate allows you to publicly invalidate your key if it's compromised or lost.

## 1. Why Backup Your GPG Keys?

*   **Hardware Failure:** Your computer's hard drive could fail.
*   **Accidental Deletion:** You might accidentally delete your GPG keyring.
*   **System Reinstallation:** You'll need to restore your keys after reinstalling your OS.
*   **Device Loss or Theft:** If your device is lost or stolen.

**The private master key is the most important part to back up securely.** Subkeys can often be regenerated if you have the master key, but backing up the entire secret keyring (master + subkeys) is a common practice.

## 2. Backing Up Your Secret GPG Keys

You should have generated your GPG keypair in the previous step ([3.1_Generating_Keys.md](./3.1_Generating_Keys.md)).

1.  **Export Your Entire Secret Keyring (Master + All Subkeys):**
    This command exports all secret keys associated with `YOUR_GPG_MASTER_KEY_ID_OR_EMAIL` in an ASCII-armored format.
    ```bash
    # Replace YOUR_GPG_MASTER_KEY_ID_OR_EMAIL with your actual GPG master key identifier
    gpg --export-secret-keys --armor YOUR_GPG_MASTER_KEY_ID_OR_EMAIL > ~/gpg_secret_keys_backup_YYYY-MM-DD.asc
    ```
    *   Replace `YYYY-MM-DD` with the current date for versioning.
    *   You will be prompted for your GPG passphrase to authorize the export.

2.  **(Optional) Export Secret Subkeys Only (for "Online" Machines):**
    If you plan to keep your master private key offline and only use subkeys on your daily machine (an advanced security practice), you can export only the secret subkeys:
    ```bash
    gpg --export-secret-subkeys --armor YOUR_GPG_MASTER_KEY_ID_OR_EMAIL > ~/gpg_secret_subkeys_backup_YYYY-MM-DD.asc
    ```
    For most `pass` users who keep their full GPG key on their primary machine, the full secret key backup (step 1) is sufficient.

## 3. Secure Storage of Key Backups

The exported `.asc` file containing your secret key(s) is **extremely sensitive**. It is protected by your GPG passphrase, but if an attacker gets both the file and your passphrase, they have your key.

*   **Offline Storage:** Store the backup file on **multiple offline media**.
    *   Encrypted USB drives (use LUKS/VeraCrypt for an extra layer of encryption on the drive itself).
    *   Archival-quality optical media (CD-R, DVD-R, M-DISC).
    *   Paper backups (e.g., using `paperkey` to print a representation of the key, though this is more complex).
*   **Geographical Distribution:** Keep backups in at least two physically separate, secure locations (e.g., your home, a safe deposit box, a trusted family member's secure location). This protects against disasters like fire or theft.
*   **Passphrase Security:** Your GPG passphrase is the ultimate protection for these backups. Ensure it's strong, unique, and you can remember it or have it stored very securely (e.g., in a different password manager or written down and kept with one of the physical backups, separate from others).

## 4. Generating a Revocation Certificate

A revocation certificate is a special GPG message that, when published or imported, marks your public GPG key as no longer valid. You generate this *in advance* and keep it secure. You only use it if your private key is compromised or lost.

1.  **Generate the Revocation Certificate:**
    ```bash
    # Replace YOUR_GPG_MASTER_KEY_ID_OR_EMAIL with your actual GPG master key identifier
    gpg --output ~/gpg_revocation_certificate_YOUR_GPG_ID_YYYY-MM-DD.asc --gen-revoke YOUR_GPG_MASTER_KEY_ID_OR_EMAIL
    ```
    *   Replace `YOUR_GPG_ID` and `YYYY-MM-DD` appropriately.
2.  You will be prompted to select a reason for revocation:
    ```
    Please select the reason for the revocation:
      0 = No reason specified
      1 = Key has been compromised
      2 = Key is superseded
      3 = Key is no longer used
      Q = Cancel
    (Probably you want to select 1 here)
    Your decision? 1
    ```
    Choose `1` (Key has been compromised) as a general-purpose reason for an emergency certificate.
3.  Enter an optional description (you can leave it blank).
4.  Confirm the generation.
5.  You will be prompted for your GPG passphrase to authorize the creation of the certificate.

## 5. Secure Storage of the Revocation Certificate

The revocation certificate (`.asc` file) is also sensitive, but in a different way. If an attacker gets it, they could publish it and revoke your key prematurely. However, it does *not* contain your private key.

*   **Store it securely, separate from your private key backups if possible.**
*   Printing it out and storing the paper copy in a safe place is a common recommendation.
*   You can also store it on an encrypted USB drive.
*   **Do NOT import it into your GPG keyring unless you actually intend to revoke your key.**

## 6. Restoring from Backup (If Needed)

If you need to restore your GPG keys to a new machine or after data loss:
1.  Install GnuPG on the new system.
2.  Retrieve your `gpg_secret_keys_backup_YYYY-MM-DD.asc` file from your secure backup.
3.  Import the secret keys:
    ```bash
    gpg --import /path/to/your/gpg_secret_keys_backup_YYYY-MM-DD.asc
    ```
    You will be prompted for the GPG passphrase that protected the key when it was exported.
4.  Verify the keys are imported: `gpg --list-secret-keys`.
5.  You may need to set the trust level for your own key again:
    ```bash
    gpg --edit-key YOUR_GPG_MASTER_KEY_ID_OR_EMAIL
    # gpg> trust
    # (Set to 5 for ultimate)
    # gpg> save
    ```

Taking these backup and revocation steps seriously is fundamental to the long-term security and usability of your GPG-based `pass` system.
