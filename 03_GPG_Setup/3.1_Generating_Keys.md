# üîë Generating GPG Keys (Master Key + Subkeys)

**Page Objective:** This page guides you through creating a GPG Master Key and its associated Subkeys for encryption, signing, and authentication, following best practices for security.

For optimal security, we'll create a Master Key (primarily for certifying subkeys) and separate Subkeys for different operations. The Master Key's private part can then be stored offline for enhanced protection.

## 1. Start GPG Key Generation

Open Konsole (or your preferred terminal) on your Arch Linux system.

1.  Launch the expert key generation process:
    ```bash
    gpg --expert --full-generate-key
    ```

2.  Follow the interactive prompts from GPG:
    *   `Please select what kind of key you want:` A good modern choice is `(9) ECC and ECC`. If you need broader compatibility or prefer RSA, choose `(1) RSA and RSA`.
        *   If ECC: For `Curve selection`, `(1) Curve 25519` is recommended.
        *   If RSA: For `What keysize do you want?`, choose `4096` bits.
    *   `Specify how long the key should be valid. (0 = key does not expire)`: It's good practice to set an expiration date (e.g., `2y` for 2 years) for the master key. You can extend it later. For subkeys, shorter validity (e.g., `1y`) can be considered.
    *   Confirm your choices are correct (`y`).
    *   Provide your **Real name**, **Email address**, and an optional **Comment**.
    *   When asked `Change (N)ame, (C)omment, (E)mail or (O)kay/(Q)uit?`, type `O` and press Enter.
    *   You will be prompted to create a **very strong passphrase** for your Master Key. This passphrase is critical. Make it unique and memorable, or store it securely using a trusted method.

## 2. Add Subkeys

Once the Master Key (which has Certify `[C]` capability by default) is generated, you should edit it to add subkeys for specific tasks.

1.  Identify your Master Key. You can use your email address or the Key ID.
    ```bash
    # Replace YOUR_GPG_MASTER_KEY_ID_OR_EMAIL with your actual GPG master key identifier
    gpg --expert --edit-key YOUR_GPG_MASTER_KEY_ID_OR_EMAIL
    ```

2.  You are now at the `gpg>` prompt. Type the following GPG internal commands and respond to the subsequent GPG prompts:

    *   **Add an Encryption Subkey `[E]`:** This is the subkey `pass` will primarily use.
        ```
        gpg> addkey
        ```
        Then, GPG will prompt you:
        *   `Please select what kind of key you want:` Choose an option for encryption, e.g., `(12) ECC (encrypt only)` or `(6) RSA (encrypt only)`.
        *   If ECC, select the curve (e.g., `(1) Curve 25519`).
        *   Set validity (e.g., `1y`).
        *   Confirm and create. You'll need to enter your Master Key passphrase.

    *   **Add a Signing Subkey `[S]`:**
        ```
        gpg> addkey
        ```
        Then, GPG will prompt you:
        *   `Please select what kind of key you want:` Choose an option for signing, e.g., `(10) ECC (sign only)` or `(4) RSA (sign only)`.
        *   If ECC, select the curve.
        *   Set validity.
        *   Confirm and create, entering your Master Key passphrase.

    *   **(Optional but Recommended) Add an Authentication Subkey `[A]`:** Useful if you plan to use GPG for SSH authentication.
        ```
        gpg> addkey
        ```
        Then, GPG will prompt you:
        *   `Please select what kind of key you want:` Choose an option to set your own capabilities (e.g., `(10) ECC (set your own capabilities)` or `(8) RSA (set your own capabilities)`).
        *   You will then be prompted to toggle capabilities. Ensure only `Authenticate` is `on`. For RSA, the interaction might be:
            ```
            Current capabilities: Sign, Encrypt
               (S) Toggle the sign capability
               (E) Toggle the encrypt capability
               (A) Toggle the authenticate capability
               (Q) Finished
            Your selection? S  # (Type S then Enter, if Sign is currently ON)
            Your selection? E  # (Type E then Enter, if Encrypt is currently ON)
            Your selection? A  # (Type A then Enter, if Authenticate is currently OFF)
            Your selection? Q
            ```
        *   If ECC, select the curve.
        *   Set validity.
        *   Confirm and create, entering your Master Key passphrase.

    *   **Save all changes and exit the GPG prompt:**
        ```
        gpg> save
        ```

## 3. Identify Your Encryption Subkey ID for `pass`

You need the specific ID of the **Encryption Subkey** to initialize `pass`.

1.  List your secret keys again:
    ```bash
    # Replace YOUR_GPG_MASTER_KEY_ID_OR_EMAIL with your actual GPG master key identifier
    gpg --list-secret-keys --keyid-format long YOUR_GPG_MASTER_KEY_ID_OR_EMAIL
    ```

2.  Look at the output. It will resemble this structure (key types and IDs will vary):
    ```
    sec   rsa4096/0xMASTERKEYFINGERPRINTPART 2023-01-01 [SC] [expires: 2025-01-01]
          MASTERKEYFULLFINGERPRINT
    uid                 [ultimate] Your Name <your.email@example.com>
    ssb   rsa4096/YOUR_GPG_ENCRYPTION_SUBKEY_ID 2023-01-01 [E] [expires: 2024-01-01]
    ssb   rsa4096/0xSIGNINGSUBKEYID 2023-01-01 [S] [expires: 2024-01-01]
    ssb   rsa4096/0xAUTHENTICATIONSUBKEYID 2023-01-01 [A] [expires: 2024-01-01]
    ```
    *   Locate the line starting with `ssb` that has the `[E]` (Encrypt) capability.
    *   The string immediately after the key type/size (e.g., `rsa4096/` or `cv25519/`) is the **Subkey ID**. For example, `YOUR_GPG_ENCRYPTION_SUBKEY_ID`. This is the value you need. It's typically a 16-character hexadecimal string (or longer if it's the full fingerprint).

You have now generated your GPG keys with a security-conscious master-key/subkey setup!
