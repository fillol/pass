# ‚öôÔ∏è Using Android Password Store (APS) on Android

**Page Objective:** This page provides a guide to everyday operations within `Android Password Store (APS)` on your Android device, such as finding passwords, copying them, adding new entries, and generating passwords.

APS provides a mobile-friendly interface to your `pass` repository, leveraging OpenKeychain for GPG operations and SSH access.

## 1. Launching APS

Tap the "Password Store" (or APS) icon in your app drawer to open the application.

## 2. Main Interface Overview

*   **Main Screen:** Displays a list or tree view of your password entries and folders, similar to how `pass ls` or `qtpass` would show them.
*   **Search Bar:** Usually at the top, allowing you to quickly find password entries by name.
*   **Floating Action Button (`+`):** Typically at the bottom right, used for adding new password entries or generating new passwords.
*   **Menu (‚ò∞ or ‚ãÆ):** Provides access to settings, synchronization, and other actions.

## 3. Basic Operations

*   **Finding and Viewing a Password:**
    1.  Use the search bar to type parts of the password entry's name/path.
    2.  Or, navigate through the folders to find the desired entry.
    3.  Tap on the password entry.

*   **Copying Password / Username / Other Fields:**
    1.  When you tap an entry, APS will typically decrypt it (OpenKeychain will prompt for your GPG passphrase if not cached).
    2.  The default action is often to **copy the password (first line) to the clipboard**. You'll usually see a toast notification confirming this.
    3.  **Viewing Details:** Some entries might show a "details" view or allow you to expand them.
    4.  **Copying Username/Other Fields:**
        *   Often, if you **long-press** an entry in the list, a context menu appears with options to copy the username (if detected) or other specific fields (if your password file has them, e.g., `username: myuser`).
        *   Alternatively, after opening an entry, there might be separate buttons or tappable areas for different fields within the password file if APS can parse them. APS can be configured with regular expressions to detect these fields.

*   **Clipboard Timeout:** Android has limitations on how long apps can keep things in the clipboard, especially in the background. APS usually clears the clipboard automatically after a short period (e.g., 30-60 seconds) for security.

*   **Adding a New Password:**
    1.  Tap the Floating Action Button (`+`).
    2.  Select "Add password" or "New entry".
    3.  You'll be prompted for:
        *   **Path/Name:** The full path for the password entry (e.g., `Web/mynewsite.com/login`).
        *   **Password:** Enter and confirm the password.
        *   **Additional Details (Optional):** You might be able to add other lines like username, URL, notes directly.
    4.  Tap "Save" or "OK". APS encrypts the new entry using OpenKeychain and commits it to the local Git repository.

*   **Generating a New Password:**
    1.  Tap the Floating Action Button (`+`).
    2.  Select "Generate password".
    3.  You'll be prompted for the path/name.
    4.  You can usually configure the password generation options (length, include symbols, numbers, etc.) either here or in APS's global settings.
    5.  Tap "Generate" or "Save". The new password is created, encrypted, and committed. The generated password is often copied to the clipboard.

*   **Editing an Existing Password:**
    1.  Navigate to and open the password entry you wish to edit.
    2.  Look for an "Edit" icon (often a pencil) or an option in a menu (e.g., by long-pressing the entry).
    3.  An editor will appear allowing you to modify the decrypted content of the password file.
    4.  Make your changes and save. APS will re-encrypt and commit the changes.

*   **Deleting a Password:**
    1.  Navigate to the password entry.
    2.  Long-press the entry in the list or find a "Delete" option after opening it.
    3.  Confirm the deletion. APS removes the file and commits the change.

## 4. Synchronization (Git Operations)

APS needs to sync with your remote Git server to pull changes made on other devices and push changes made on Android.

*   **Sync Button:** Look for a "Sync" icon (often two circular arrows) in the app's toolbar or main menu.
*   Tapping this button will usually perform:
    1.  A `git pull` (often with `--rebase`) to fetch and integrate remote changes.
    2.  A `git push` to send your local commits (new/edited/deleted passwords) to the server.
*   **Automatic Sync:** APS might have settings for automatic synchronization at certain intervals or on app launch, but manual sync is always reliable.

**It's good practice to sync:**
*   When you open APS, to get the latest changes.
*   After adding or modifying passwords on Android, before closing APS or switching devices.

## 5. `pass-otp` (TOTP) Support

If you use `pass-otp` and have `otpauth://` URIs stored in your password files:
1.  When you open an entry that contains an OTP secret, APS will usually detect it.
2.  It will display the current **Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP)** code.
3.  The code will refresh automatically (typically every 30 seconds).
4.  There's often a button or option to easily copy the OTP code to the clipboard.

This makes APS a very convenient tool for 2FA, as your passwords and OTP secrets are managed together.

## 6. Settings and Configuration

Explore APS settings (usually accessible from the main menu):
*   **Git Settings:** Verify repository URL, branch name, username, email.
*   **GPG Settings:** Verify the correct GPG key is selected.
*   **Password Generation Defaults:** Set default length, character types.
*   **Field Detection:** Configure regular expressions to help APS identify and separately display/copy fields like "username", "URL", etc., from your password files.
*   **Appearance/Theme.**
*   **Autofill Service (Android 8.0+):** APS can often act as an Android Autofill service, allowing it to automatically fill login credentials in other apps and browsers. You'll need to enable this in your Android system settings (`Settings -> System -> Languages & input -> Advanced -> Autofill service`).

Using APS effectively involves getting comfortable with these operations and remembering to synchronize regularly.
