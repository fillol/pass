# ⚙️ Synchronization Workflow

**Page Objective:** This page outlines best practices and common workflows for keeping your `pass` password store synchronized across all your devices (Arch Linux desktop, Android phone, any other clients).

Effective synchronization is key to ensuring you always have the most up-to-date passwords available wherever you need them and to avoid or minimize Git merge conflicts. The underlying mechanism is Git.

## Core Principle: Pull Before Push, Sync Often

The most important rule is to **pull changes from the server before you push your local changes, or ideally, before you even start making local changes.** This helps integrate any modifications made on other devices first.

## Synchronization on Arch Linux Desktop

### Using the Command Line (`pass git ...`)

1.  **Before Modifying or Adding Passwords (Recommended):**
    Open a terminal and navigate to your password store (or use `pass git` which works from anywhere if the store is at the default location):
    ```bash
    pass git pull --rebase
    ```
    *   `pull` fetches changes from the remote (`origin`) and merges them.
    *   `--rebase` attempts to re-apply your local, unpushed commits on top of the fetched changes. This often results in a cleaner, more linear history than a merge commit, especially for a personal password store. If there are complex conflicting changes, a rebase might be paused for you to resolve conflicts.

2.  **After Making Changes (Adding, Editing, Deleting Passwords):**
    `pass` commands like `insert`, `edit`, `rm`, `generate`, `mv`, `cp` automatically create Git commits for you.
    Once you're done making a batch of changes, push them to the server:
    ```bash
    pass git push
    ```

3.  **Combined Sync Alias (Example):**
    You might create a shell alias in your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc` for convenience:
    ```bash
    # Pulls with rebase, then pushes
    alias pass-sync='pass git pull --rebase && pass git push'
    ```
    Then you can just run `pass-sync`.

### Using `qtpass` (KDE GUI)

1.  **Before Modifying:**
    *   Click the **"Pull"** button in the `qtpass` toolbar or find the option in its "Git" or "Repository" menu.
    *   Check `qtpass` settings to see if you can configure the pull strategy (e.g., to use rebase by default).

2.  **After Making Changes:**
    *   After adding, editing, or deleting passwords via `qtpass`, click the **"Push"** button.

## Synchronization on Android (Using APS)

1.  **When Opening APS (Recommended):**
    *   Tap the **"Sync"** icon (often circular arrows) in APS. This usually performs both a pull and a push.
    *   APS typically tries to be smart about this, often pulling first (sometimes with rebase if configured or by default for its Git library) and then pushing any local changes.

2.  **After Making Changes in APS:**
    *   Before closing APS or if you know you've made changes, tap the **"Sync"** icon again to ensure your changes are pushed to the server.

3.  **Automatic Sync (If Enabled):**
    *   APS might have settings for periodic background synchronization or syncing on app open/close. Relying solely on this can sometimes lead to outdated states if the sync fails silently, so manual syncs are still good practice.

## Handling Merge Conflicts

Merge conflicts are rare in a personal `pass` setup if you sync frequently and generally edit different passwords on different devices between syncs. However, they can happen if, for example, you edit the *same* password entry on two devices before either has synced the other's changes.

*   **Detection:**
    *   `git pull` or `pass git pull` will fail and tell you there's a merge conflict.
    *   APS or `qtpass` might show an error message during sync.

*   **Resolution (Usually on Desktop CLI - More Control):**
    1.  Run `pass git pull` (or just `git pull` from within `~/.password-store`) on your desktop.
    2.  Git will mark the conflicted files (e.g., `some/password.gpg`).
    3.  **You cannot directly edit the `.gpg` file to resolve conflicts because it's encrypted.**
    4.  **Strategy:**
        *   Decide which version you want to keep or how to merge them.
        *   It's often easiest to:
            a.  Show the "local" version: `pass show some/password` (this is *your* version before the pull). Copy its content.
            b.  Show the "remote" version (this is trickier, as Git has it in a conflicted state). You might need to use Git commands to checkout `HEAD`'s version or `MERGE_HEAD`'s version of the `.gpg` file, decrypt it, then compare.
            c.  A simpler approach for `pass`:
                ```bash
                # Abort the problematic merge if you're stuck (losing current merge attempt)
                # git merge --abort
                # OR, if it was a rebase:
                # git rebase --abort

                # Decide which version to keep (e.g., assume desktop version is what you want to force)
                # Or manually reconstruct the desired state
                pass edit some/password # Make it look exactly how you want the final version
                # This creates a new commit.
                # Now try pulling and pushing again.
                pass git pull --rebase
                pass git push
                ```
        *   **If `git pull --rebase` pauses due to conflicts:**
            ```bash
            git status # Shows conflicted files
            # For each conflicted file.gpg:
            # 1. Decrypt the version from "our" branch (the one being rebased):
            #    git show :2:path/to/file.gpg | gpg -d > /tmp/our_version.txt
            # 2. Decrypt the version from "their" branch (the one being rebased onto):
            #    git show :3:path/to/file.gpg | gpg -d > /tmp/their_version.txt
            # 3. Compare /tmp/our_version.txt and /tmp/their_version.txt.
            # 4. Create the merged content in a new file, say /tmp/merged_content.txt
            # 5. Re-insert it into pass, which handles encryption and staging:
            #    pass insert -f path/to/file < /tmp/merged_content.txt
            #    (or use `gpg -e -r YOUR_GPG_ID -o path/to/file.gpg /tmp/merged_content.txt`
            #     then `git add path/to/file.gpg`)
            # 6. After resolving all conflicts:
            #    git rebase --continue
            ```
            Resolving Git conflicts with encrypted files is advanced. The simplest way is often to pick one version as authoritative if you can afford to lose the intermediate change from the other side, or manually re-enter the combined information.

*   **Prevention:** Sync often! Especially before editing.

## General Workflow Summary

1.  **Start of session (any device):** Sync (Pull from server).
2.  **Make your changes:** Add, edit, generate passwords.
3.  **End of session / before switching devices:** Sync (Push to server).

This disciplined approach minimizes issues and keeps your password store consistent across all your clients.
