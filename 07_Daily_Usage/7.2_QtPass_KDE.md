# ‚öôÔ∏è Using `qtpass` (KDE GUI on Arch Linux)

**Page Objective:** This page explains how to use `qtpass`, a Qt-based graphical user interface for `pass`, on your Arch Linux system with KDE Plasma.

`qtpass` provides a more visual way to interact with your password store, complementing the command-line capabilities of `pass`. It's particularly useful for users who prefer a GUI or want a quick overview of their password structure.

## 1. Launching `qtpass`

You can launch `qtpass` from your KDE application launcher (Kicker) by searching for "qtpass", or by typing `qtpass` in a terminal:
```bash
qtpass &
```
The `&` runs it in the background, freeing up your terminal.

## 2. Main Interface Overview

The `qtpass` interface typically consists of:

*   **Left Pane:** A tree view of your password store, showing folders and encrypted password files (ending in `.gpg`).
*   **Right Pane:** Displays the content of the selected password file (after decryption).
    *   The first line is usually the password.
    *   Subsequent lines can be metadata like username, URL, notes, or OTPauth URIs for `pass-otp`.
*   **Toolbar/Menubar:** Contains buttons and menu items for common actions.

## 3. Basic Operations

*   **Viewing/Decrypting a Password:**
    1.  Navigate the tree in the left pane and select the password entry you want to view.
    2.  The content will be decrypted and shown in the right pane. You will be prompted for your GPG passphrase by `gpg-agent` (via `pinentry-qt`) if it's not cached.
    3.  There are usually buttons to:
        *   **Copy Password:** Copies the first line (the password) to the clipboard.
        *   **Copy Username:** If `qtpass` detects a username field (e.g., a line starting with `user:` or `login:`), this button might become active.
        *   **Copy Other Fields:** You can often right-click or select other lines to copy them.

*   **Adding a New Password:**
    1.  Click the "Add" or "New" button on the toolbar, or go to `File -> New Password`.
    2.  A dialog will appear asking for the path/name of the new password (e.g., `Web/mynewsite.com/username`).
    3.  You'll then be prompted to enter the password and optionally other details in an editor-like window or separate fields.
    4.  Upon saving, `qtpass` will call `pass insert` or `pass generate` in the background.

*   **Generating a New Password:**
    1.  Similar to adding, but choose "Generate" or `File -> Generate Password`.
    2.  You'll specify the path/name and often options like password length and whether to include symbols.
    3.  `qtpass` uses `pass generate` for this.

*   **Editing an Existing Password:**
    1.  Select the password entry.
    2.  Click the "Edit" button or `File -> Edit Password`.
    3.  The decrypted content will open in a text area or your system's default editor (this might be configurable in `qtpass` settings).
    4.  Make your changes and save. `qtpass` calls `pass edit` in the background.

*   **Deleting a Password:**
    1.  Select the password entry.
    2.  Click the "Delete" or "Remove" button, or `File -> Delete Password`.
    3.  You'll be asked for confirmation.

*   **Creating Folders:**
    You usually create folders by including them in the path when adding a new password (e.g., `NewFolder/new_password`). `qtpass` might also have a "New Folder" option.

## 4. Synchronization (Git Operations)

`qtpass` provides buttons or menu items for Git operations:

*   **Pull (Fetch & Merge/Rebase):**
    Click the "Pull" button (often an arrow pointing down) or find it in a "Git" or "Repository" menu. This runs `pass git pull` to fetch changes from your remote server.
    *   You might be able to configure `qtpass` to use rebase (`--rebase`) by default in its settings.

*   **Push:**
    Click the "Push" button (often an arrow pointing up) or find it in a menu. This runs `pass git push` to send your local commits (new passwords, edits) to the server.
    *   If your SSH key has a passphrase, `ssh-agent` (or KWallet integration with `gpg-agent`'s SSH support) should handle it.

*   **Commit:**
    While `pass` commands often commit automatically, if you make changes that `qtpass` doesn't auto-commit (less common), there might be a "Commit" option.

**It's good practice to "Pull" before making significant changes or adding new passwords, especially if you use multiple devices, to avoid merge conflicts.** Then "Push" after you've made your changes.

## 5. Settings and Configuration

`qtpass` has a settings/preferences dialog (usually under `Edit -> Settings` or `File -> Preferences`). Key things to check/configure:

*   **Password Store Location:** Should default to `~/.password-store` but verify.
*   **GPG Key:** `qtpass` should automatically use the GPG key specified in `~/.password-store/.gpg-id`.
*   **Clipboard Timeout:** How long passwords stay in the clipboard.
*   **Git Options:** Default pull strategy (merge vs. rebase), paths to `git` and `pass` if not in standard locations.
*   **Editor:** Which text editor to use when editing passwords.
*   **Username Detection:** Regular expressions to detect usernames or other fields.

## 6. `pass-otp` Integration

If you have `pass-otp` installed and have added OTP secrets to your entries (e.g., `otpauth://...` lines), `qtpass` can often display the current TOTP code.
*   Select an entry with an OTP.
*   There might be a dedicated button/field to show the OTP or an option to copy it.
*   The OTP code usually updates automatically every 30 seconds.

`qtpass` offers a convenient and user-friendly way to manage your `pass` store on KDE Plasma, especially for users who prefer GUIs over the command line for some tasks. However, understanding the underlying `pass` CLI commands is still beneficial.
