# ‚öôÔ∏è CLI Usage on Arch Linux (`pass` command)

**Page Objective:** This page covers the essential command-line interface (CLI) commands for `pass` on your Arch Linux system, allowing you to efficiently manage your password store.

The `pass` command is powerful and forms the core of the password manager. All GUI tools and extensions ultimately interact with this CLI.

## Basic Structure

Passwords in `pass` are stored in a directory hierarchy. For example, a password for `your_username` at `gmail.com` might be stored as `Email/gmail.com/your_username.gpg`.

## Common `pass` Commands

Open Konsole or your preferred terminal.

1.  **List All Passwords:**
    Shows the tree structure of your password store.
    ```bash
    pass
    # or
    pass ls
    # To list passwords in a subfolder:
    pass ls Social
    ```

2.  **Show/Decrypt a Password (and copy to clipboard):**
    This is the most common command to retrieve a password. It decrypts the password, prints it to standard output, and copies it to the clipboard for 45 seconds by default (this duration is configurable via the `PASSWORD_STORE_CLIP_TIME` environment variable).
    ```bash
    pass Email/gmail.com
    # or, if you have a username level:
    pass Email/gmail.com/your_username
    ```
    You will be prompted for your GPG passphrase if it's not cached by `gpg-agent`.

3.  **Copy Password to Clipboard (without printing to stdout):**
    If you only want to copy the password to the clipboard:
    ```bash
    pass -c Email/gmail.com
    # or
    pass --clip Email/gmail.com
    ```

4.  **Add a New Password (Insert):**
    This command prompts you to enter a password twice.
    ```bash
    pass insert Website/my_new_service.com
    # For multi-line passwords (e.g., private keys, recovery codes):
    pass insert -m path/to/your/multiline_entry
    # or
    pass insert --multiline path/to/your/multiline_entry
    ```
    `pass` will automatically encrypt the password with your GPG key and `git commit` the change.

5.  **Generate a New Random Password (and Insert):**
    `pass` can generate cryptographically strong random passwords.
    ```bash
    # Generate a 20-character password with symbols and numbers
    pass generate Services/another_service 20
    # Generate a 16-character password with no symbols (-n)
    pass generate -n Web/forum_xyz 16
    # Generate and copy the new password to clipboard (-c) without printing
    pass generate -c Services/new_secure_site 25
    # Force overwrite if entry exists (-f)
    pass generate -f Services/another_service 22
    ```
    The generated password is automatically inserted, encrypted, and committed.

6.  **Edit an Existing Password:**
    This decrypts the password into a temporary file, opens it in your default text editor (`$EDITOR`, e.g., `nano` or `vim`), and then re-encrypts and commits it upon saving and closing the editor.
    ```bash
    pass edit Banking/my_bank_account
    ```
    You can change the password or any other information stored in the file (like username, URL, notes). The first line is typically the password itself.

7.  **Remove a Password:**
    Deletes the specified password file and commits the deletion.
    ```bash
    pass rm OldStuff/unused_account
    ```
    You'll be asked for confirmation.

8.  **Find/Search for Passwords:**
    Searches the names of password files (not their contents).
    ```bash
    pass find bank
    pass find gmail
    ```

9.  **Rename/Move a Password:**
    Uses `git mv` internally.
    ```bash
    pass mv OldPath/old_name NewPath/new_name
    # Example:
    pass mv Web/forum_xyz Social/forum_xyz
    ```

10. **Copy a Password File (Duplicate):**
    Uses `git cp` internally.
    ```bash
    pass cp Existing/password New/copied_password
    # Example:
    pass cp Email/template_account Email/new_service_based_on_template
    ```

11. **Git Interaction:**
    `pass` heavily relies on Git. While many `pass` commands (like `insert`, `edit`, `rm`, `generate`) automatically commit changes, you'll need to manually pull and push to synchronize with your server.
    *   **Pull changes from server:**
        ```bash
        pass git pull
        # Or, to rebase your local changes on top of remote changes (often cleaner):
        pass git pull --rebase
        ```
    *   **Push local changes to server:**
        ```bash
        pass git push
        ```
    *   **Check status:**
        ```bash
        pass git status
        ```
    *   **View log:**
        ```bash
        pass git log
        ```

## Tab Completion

`pass` usually comes with bash/zsh completion scripts. Ensure they are active in your shell for easier typing of password paths. If not working, you might need to source the completion script (e.g., `/usr/share/bash-completion/completions/pass` for bash) in your shell's configuration file (`.bashrc` or `.zshrc`). Pacman often handles this.

Mastering these CLI commands will allow you to use `pass` very effectively and quickly.
