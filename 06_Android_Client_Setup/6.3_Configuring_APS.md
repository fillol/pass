# üì± Configuring APS to Sync with Your Git Server

**Page Objective:** This page provides a step-by-step guide to configuring Android Password Store (APS) to clone your `pass` Git repository from your self-hosted server, set up SSH authentication using OpenKeychain, and select your GPG key for password decryption.

With your GPG encryption subkey imported into OpenKeychain and an SSH key configured within OpenKeychain for server access, you're ready to set up APS.

## 1. Initial Setup in APS

1.  Open the **Android Password Store (APS)** app on your Android device.
2.  If this is the first time you're running APS, it will likely present you with setup options. If you've used it before, you might need to go into its settings to add a new repository or modify an existing one.
3.  Choose the option to **"Clone existing repository"** or a similar wording like "Set up `pass` repository".

## 2. Configure Git Repository Settings

You will be presented with several fields to fill in:

*   **Repository Location / Git Repository URL:**
    This is the SSH URL to your self-hosted Git server. It should be in the format:
    `ssh://YOUR_SERVER_GIT_USER@YOUR_SERVER_HOSTNAME_OR_IP/YOUR_GIT_REPO_PATH_ON_SERVER`

    *   **Important Note on Paths:**
        *   If `YOUR_GIT_REPO_PATH_ON_SERVER` is relative to `YOUR_SERVER_GIT_USER`'s home directory (e.g., the repository is at `/home/YOUR_SERVER_GIT_USER/password-store.git`), the URL might be:
            `ssh://YOUR_SERVER_GIT_USER@YOUR_SERVER_HOSTNAME_OR_IP/password-store.git`
            (Note: some SSH clients or servers might not need the leading `/` if the path is relative to home, so `ssh://USER@HOST/repo.git` might work if `repo.git` is directly in the home directory. Experiment if needed.)
        *   If `YOUR_GIT_REPO_PATH_ON_SERVER` is an **absolute path** outside the user's home (e.g., `/srv/git/password-store.git`), you often need a **double slash `//`** after the hostname in the SSH URL for many clients to correctly interpret the absolute path on the server:
            `ssh://YOUR_SERVER_GIT_USER@YOUR_SERVER_HOSTNAME_OR_IP//srv/git/password-store.git`
            This is a common point of failure, so try both single and double slashes if one doesn't work.

*   **SSH Key for Authentication:**
    APS will use OpenKeychain to provide an SSH key.
    *   Ensure you have an SSH key available in **OpenKeychain** and that its **public key has been added to your server's `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file** for `YOUR_SERVER_GIT_USER` (as detailed in [Section 4.4](../04_Server_Git_Setup/4.4_Configuring_SSH_Access.md)).
    *   APS should automatically detect and allow you to select an SSH identity managed by OpenKeychain. If prompted, choose the correct SSH key you intend to use for this server.

*   **GPG Key ID for Decryption:**
    APS needs to know which GPG key to use for decrypting passwords.
    *   Tap to select your GPG key. APS will query OpenKeychain for available keys.
    *   Choose the GPG key identity (e.g., "Your Name <your.email@example.com>") that you imported in the previous step ([Section 6.2](./6.2_Importing_GPG_Key.md)). This key must contain the encryption subkey.

*   **Git User Name:**
    Enter your name, e.g., "Your Name". This will be used for Git commits made from APS.

*   **Git User Email:**
    Enter your email, e.g., "your.email@example.com". This should ideally match the email in your GPG key and your desktop Git configuration.

*   **Git Branch Name:**
    Enter the name of your primary branch, which is likely `main` (or `master` if you used an older default). This must match the branch name on your server.

## 3. Start Cloning

1.  Once all fields are correctly filled, tap "OK", "Clone", "Save", or the equivalent confirmation button.
2.  APS will attempt to:
    *   Connect to your server via SSH using the key from OpenKeychain.
    *   Clone the Git repository.
3.  You might see progress indicators. OpenKeychain may also pop up to ask for confirmation to use the SSH key or to request the GPG passphrase if it needs to perform GPG operations during setup (though usually decryption happens when you first access a password).

## 4. First Synchronization and Verification

1.  If the cloning is successful, APS should display the contents of your password store (e.g., the `test/example.com` password you added from your desktop).
2.  Try to open the test password:
    *   Tap on the `test/example.com` entry.
    *   OpenKeychain should prompt you for your GPG passphrase (if it's not cached) to decrypt the password.
    *   If successful, the password content should be displayed or copied to the clipboard.
3.  **Test Synchronization:**
    *   Try adding a new test password directly from APS.
    *   Then, use the "Sync" or "Push/Pull" button in APS (often a circular arrows icon).
    *   This should push the new password from Android to your server.
    *   Afterward, on your Arch Linux desktop, run `pass git pull` (or sync via `qtpass`). The new password from Android should appear.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues:

*   **Cannot Clone / Connection Refused / Authentication Failed:**
    *   **Double-check the Git Repository URL in APS:** Pay close attention to the `ssh://` prefix and the slashes for the path, especially if it's an absolute path on the server.
    *   **Verify SSH Key in OpenKeychain:** Ensure the correct SSH key is active in OpenKeychain and its public part is *exactly* what's in the server's `authorized_keys` file for `YOUR_SERVER_GIT_USER`.
    *   **Server SSH Daemon Logs:** Check `/var/log/auth.log` or `journalctl -u sshd` on your server for error messages related to the connection attempt.
    *   **Permissions on Server:** Confirm `~/.ssh` (700) and `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` (600) permissions for `YOUR_SERVER_GIT_USER`.
    *   **Firewall:** Ensure your server's firewall allows SSH connections on the correct port.

*   **Cannot Decrypt Passwords / "No Secret Key":**
    *   **Correct GPG Key Selected in APS:** Ensure APS is configured to use the GPG key you imported into OpenKeychain, which holds the necessary encryption subkey.
    *   **GPG Key Imported Correctly in OpenKeychain:** Double-check that the GPG encryption subkey was successfully imported into OpenKeychain and is usable.

Your Android Password Store should now be fully configured and synchronized with your self-hosted `pass` repository!
