# üì± Installing Necessary Apps (APS & OpenKeychain)

**Page Objective:** This page guides you through finding and installing the two essential Android applications required to use your `pass` password store: `Android Password Store (APS)` and `OpenKeychain: Easy PGP`.

These apps work together: OpenKeychain manages your GPG keys and handles cryptographic operations, while APS provides the interface to your password store and syncs with your Git server.

## 1. App Sources: F-Droid or Google Play Store

Both applications are open source and available on F-Droid (the recommended source for open-source apps) and the Google Play Store.

*   **F-Droid:** If you don't have F-Droid, you can install it by downloading the APK from [f-droid.org](https://f-droid.org). You'll need to enable "Install from Unknown Sources" in your Android settings.
*   **Google Play Store:** Search for the apps by name.

## 2. Install OpenKeychain: Easy PGP

OpenKeychain is crucial for managing your GPG keys on Android and performing encryption/decryption.

1.  **Open your chosen app store** (F-Droid or Google Play Store) on your Android device.
2.  **Search for "OpenKeychain"**. Look for the app named "OpenKeychain: Easy PGP".
    *   *Developer on Play Store is usually "OpenKeychain Maintainers" or similar.*
3.  **Tap "Install"** and wait for the download and installation to complete.

## 3. Install Android Password Store (APS)

APS is the client application for `pass` on Android.

1.  **Open your chosen app store** (F-Droid or Google Play Store).
2.  **Search for "Android Password Store"**.
    *   *Developer on Play Store is often "Android Password Store Maintainers" or "Zeapo".*
3.  **Tap "Install"** and wait for the download and installation to complete.

## 4. Grant Necessary Permissions

After installation, when you first open these apps, they might request certain permissions.
*   **OpenKeychain** will likely need access to storage to import/export keys.
*   **Android Password Store** might need storage access (to clone the repository locally) and network access (to sync with your Git server).

Review and grant the necessary permissions for the apps to function correctly.

With both OpenKeychain and Android Password Store installed, your Android device is ready for the next steps: importing your GPG encryption subkey and configuring APS to connect to your server.
