# üì± Importing Your Private GPG Key (Encryption Subkey)

**Page Objective:** This page details how to securely transfer your GPG **encryption subkey** (not the master private key) to your Android device and import it into OpenKeychain.

For security reasons, it's best practice to only have the necessary subkeys on your mobile device, keeping your master private key offline or on a more secure primary machine. `pass` only requires the encryption subkey to decrypt passwords.

## 1. Export the GPG Encryption Subkey (from your Desktop)

You should have already identified `YOUR_GPG_ENCRYPTION_SUBKEY_ID` in [Section 3.1](../03_GPG_Setup/3.1_Generating_Keys.md).

1.  On your Arch Linux desktop (or wherever your GPG keys are managed), open a terminal.
2.  Use the following command to export **only the secret part of the encryption subkey**:
    ```bash
    # Replace YOUR_GPG_ENCRYPTION_SUBKEY_ID with the actual ID of your [E] subkey.
    # The "!" suffix is crucial for GnuPG version 2.1 and later to export only the subkey.
    gpg --export-secret-keys --armor YOUR_GPG_ENCRYPTION_SUBKEY_ID! > ~/encryption_subkey_for_android.asc
    ```
    This command creates a file named `encryption_subkey_for_android.asc` in your home directory (`~`) containing the ASCII-armored secret subkey.

## 2. Securely Transfer the Subkey File to Your Android Device

You need to transfer the `encryption_subkey_for_android.asc` file to your Android device. **Use a secure method**, as this file contains sensitive key material (even though it's passphrase-protected).

*   **USB Cable (MTP):** Connect your phone to your computer via USB, enable MTP/File Transfer mode on your phone, and copy the file to your phone's internal storage or SD card (e.g., into the `Downloads` folder).
*   **`scp` (Secure Copy):** If you have an SSH server running on your phone (e.g., via Termux), you can use `scp`.
    ```bash
    # On your desktop
    scp ~/encryption_subkey_for_android.asc your_phone_user@YOUR_PHONE_IP_ADDRESS:/sdcard/Download/
    ```
*   **Syncthing/KDE Connect (over trusted network):** If you use file synchronization tools over a trusted network, you can use them.
*   **Avoid insecure methods** like emailing it to yourself unencrypted or using public cloud storage without additional encryption.

## 3. Import the Subkey into OpenKeychain

1.  On your Android device, open the **OpenKeychain** app.
2.  Tap the menu icon (‚ò∞ or ‚ãÆ, usually top-left or top-right).
3.  Select **"Manage My Keys"** (or similar wording like "My Keys").
4.  Tap the **`+` (plus) icon** to add a new key.
5.  Choose **"Import from File"**.
6.  Navigate your phone's storage to where you saved `encryption_subkey_for_android.asc` (e.g., your `Downloads` folder).
7.  Select the `encryption_subkey_for_android.asc` file.
8.  OpenKeychain will prompt you for the **passphrase** of your GPG key (the one you set when you created the master key, as subkeys usually share this passphrase unless explicitly changed). Enter it correctly.
9.  If successful, the key (or rather, the subkey information associated with your master key identity) should now appear in your list of keys in OpenKeychain. You should see your User ID (name and email).

## 4. Verify the Imported Key (Optional)

1.  In OpenKeychain, tap on the newly imported key entry.
2.  You can view its details, including subkeys. Confirm that the encryption subkey (`[E]`) is present.

## 5. Securely Delete the Subkey File from Android Storage

Once the key is successfully imported into OpenKeychain's protected storage, it's good practice to **delete the `encryption_subkey_for_android.asc` file** from your phone's general storage (e.g., the `Downloads` folder).
1.  Use a file manager app on your Android device.
2.  Navigate to where you saved the `.asc` file.
3.  Delete it securely.

Your GPG encryption subkey is now available to Android Password Store (APS) via OpenKeychain. APS will use OpenKeychain to decrypt passwords and to handle GPG operations for Git commits if GPG signing is enabled (though GPG signing for commits is optional for basic `pass` functionality).
