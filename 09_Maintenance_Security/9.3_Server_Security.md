# üõ°Ô∏è Server Security Best Practices

**Page Objective:** This page outlines essential security measures for your self-hosted Git server, which stores your encrypted `pass` repository. Protecting this server is critical to protecting your passwords, even though they are encrypted.

While your passwords within `pass` are GPG-encrypted, the server itself needs to be secured to prevent unauthorized access, denial of service, or potential compromise of the server environment which could, in extreme scenarios, lead to attacks against your encrypted data (e.g., if an attacker gains long-term root access and can log GPG passphrases if you ever decrypt *on* the server, which you shouldn't be doing).

## 1. Keep the System Updated

Regularly update your server's operating system and all installed packages to patch known vulnerabilities.

*   **For Debian/Ubuntu based systems:**
    ```bash
    sudo apt update && sudo apt full-upgrade
    sudo apt autoremove # To remove unused packages
    ```
*   **For Fedora/RHEL based systems:**
    ```bash
    sudo dnf upgrade --refresh
    ```
*   **For Arch Linux based systems:**
    ```bash
    sudo pacman -Syu
    ```
Consider enabling automatic security updates if your distribution supports it and you're comfortable with it.

## 2. Configure a Firewall

A firewall limits incoming network traffic to only the services that need to be exposed. For a `pass` Git server, you typically only need to allow SSH access.

*   **`ufw` (Uncomplicated Firewall - common on Ubuntu/Debian):**
    ```bash
    sudo ufw default deny incoming
    sudo ufw default allow outgoing
    sudo ufw allow ssh # Or 'sudo ufw allow 22/tcp' if SSH is on port 22
    # If you changed your SSH port to, e.g., 2222:
    # sudo ufw allow 2222/tcp
    sudo ufw enable
    sudo ufw status verbose
    ```

*   **`firewalld` (common on Fedora/RHEL):**
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl start firewalld
    sudo systemctl enable firewalld
    sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=ssh
    # If SSH is on a custom port (e.g., 2222):
    # sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=2222/tcp
    sudo firewall-cmd --reload
    sudo firewall-cmd --list-all
    ```

## 3. Secure SSH Access

SSH is your primary way to interact with the server and for Git to synchronize.

*   **Use SSH Keys for Authentication (Already Covered for Git User):**
    Ensure all users, including your administrative user and `YOUR_SERVER_GIT_USER`, primarily use SSH key-based authentication.

*   **Disable Password Authentication for SSH:**
    Once SSH keys are set up and working for all necessary users, disable password-based SSH logins to prevent brute-force attacks.
    Edit `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` (e.g., `sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config`):
    ```
    PasswordAuthentication no
    PermitEmptyPasswords no
    ChallengeResponseAuthentication no # Usually good to disable too
    ```
    Restart the SSH service: `sudo systemctl restart sshd` or `sudo service ssh restart`.
    **Test SSH key login from a new terminal *before* closing your current session!**

*   **Change Default SSH Port (Optional - Security through Obscurity):**
    Changing the SSH port from the default 22 to something else (e.g., 2222) can reduce automated bot scans.
    In `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`:
    ```
    Port 2222
    ```
    Remember to update your firewall and any client SSH configurations. This is a minor deterrent, not a primary security measure.

*   **Limit SSH Access by User/Group:**
    In `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`, you can use `AllowUsers` or `AllowGroups` to restrict which users can log in via SSH.
    ```
    AllowUsers your_admin_user YOUR_SERVER_GIT_USER
    ```

*   **Use `fail2ban`:**
    `fail2ban` scans log files (like `/var/log/auth.log`) and bans IPs that show malicious signs, such as too many password failures.
    ```bash
    # For Debian/Ubuntu
    sudo apt install fail2ban
    # For Fedora/RHEL
    sudo dnf install fail2ban
    # For Arch
    sudo pacman -S fail2ban

    # Basic configuration is often sufficient. Copy jail.conf to jail.local for customizations.
    sudo cp /etc/fail2ban/jail.conf /etc/fail2ban/jail.local
    # Edit jail.local to enable SSH protection and configure ban times if needed.
    # sudo nano /etc/fail2ban/jail.local
    # Ensure [sshd] section has 'enabled = true'.
    sudo systemctl enable fail2ban
    sudo systemctl start fail2ban
    ```

## 4. Minimize Installed Software

Only install software that is absolutely necessary for the server's function. A smaller attack surface means fewer potential vulnerabilities. Regularly review installed packages and remove unneeded ones.

## 5. Secure the `YOUR_SERVER_GIT_USER` Account

*   **Restricted Shell (`git-shell`):** As covered in [Section 4.2](./../04_Server_Git_Setup/4.2_Dedicated_User.md), using `git-shell` significantly limits what this user can do.
*   **No Sudo Access:** Ensure `YOUR_SERVER_GIT_USER` does not have `sudo` privileges.
*   **Strong, Unique (Unused) Password OR Disabled Password:** If password authentication is disabled for SSH, the local password for `YOUR_SERVER_GIT_USER` is less critical for remote attacks but should still be strong if set, or the account can be locked for password login (`sudo passwd -l YOUR_SERVER_GIT_USER`) if only SSH key access is used.

## 6. Regular Backups

*   **Server System:** Have a strategy for backing up your server's operating system and configuration (e.g., VM snapshots, filesystem backups).
*   **Git Repository:** The `pass git push` from clients effectively backs up the password store to the server. However, you should also back up the server itself, including the directory `YOUR_GIT_REPO_PATH_ON_SERVER`. This protects against server hardware failure or catastrophic data loss on the server.
    Use tools like `rsync`, `borgbackup`, or your cloud provider's backup solutions. Store these backups securely, ideally offsite and encrypted.

## 7. Monitoring and Logging

*   Regularly check system logs (e.g., `/var/log/auth.log`, `journalctl`) for suspicious activity.
*   Consider setting up centralized logging or log monitoring tools for more advanced environments.

## 8. Physical Security (If Applicable)

If your server is a physical machine you own (like a Raspberry Pi or home server), ensure it's physically secure to prevent unauthorized access.

By implementing these server security best practices, you create a much more resilient and secure environment for your self-hosted `pass` Git repository. Security is an ongoing process, not a one-time setup.
