# üõ°Ô∏è Password Rotation and Hygiene

**Page Objective:** This page discusses best practices for password rotation (changing passwords periodically) and general password hygiene, and how `pass` can facilitate these practices.

While having a strong password manager like `pass` securely stores your credentials, good password hygiene is still essential to minimize risk from data breaches on external services or other attack vectors.

## 1. Why Password Rotation and Good Hygiene?

*   **Data Breaches:** If a website you use suffers a data breach and password hashes are leaked, attackers might eventually crack them. Regularly changing passwords limits the window of opportunity for a compromised password to be used.
*   **Credential Stuffing:** Attackers use lists of breached username/password combinations to try logging into other services. Using unique passwords for every service is critical.
*   **Weak/Compromised Passwords:** If you've used weak passwords in the past or suspect a password might have been phished or keylogged.
*   **Policy Requirements:** Some organizations or services mandate password changes.

## 2. Key Principles of Password Hygiene

1.  **Uniqueness:** Every online account should have a **unique password**. `pass` makes this easy because you don't have to remember them all.
2.  **Strength/Complexity:** Passwords should be long and include a mix of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. `pass generate` is excellent for this.
    *   Aim for at least 16-20 characters for important accounts.
3.  **Avoid Predictable Patterns:** Don't use easily guessable information (birthdays, names, common words) or simple keyboard patterns.
4.  **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA/MFA):** Enable 2FA wherever possible, especially for critical accounts (email, banking, password manager master passphrase if applicable to other systems). You can store TOTP secrets for 2FA using `pass-otp` ([Section 8.1](../08_Advanced_Features/8.1_Pass_OTP.md)).
5.  **Be Wary of Phishing:** Always verify you are on the legitimate website before entering credentials.

## 3. Using `pass` for Password Rotation

`pass` makes changing passwords for your services relatively straightforward:

1.  **Identify the Password to Change:**
    Decide which account's password you want to update (e.g., `Web/example-service.com`).

2.  **Log in to the Service:**
    Use your current password (retrieved via `pass Web/example-service.com`) to log in to the service's website or app.

3.  **Navigate to Password Change Settings:**
    Find the "Change Password," "Security," or "Account Settings" section on the service's platform.

4.  **Generate a New Strong Password using `pass`:**
    Open your terminal.
    ```bash
    # Generate a new 20-character password and copy it to clipboard,
    # but don't save it to the pass store entry yet.
    pass generate -c Temp/new_password_for_example_service 20
    ```
    *   We use a temporary path like `Temp/new_password_for_example_service` so it doesn't overwrite your existing entry immediately.
    *   The `-c` flag copies the newly generated password to your clipboard.

5.  **Update Password on the Service's Website:**
    *   Enter your current password when prompted by the service.
    *   Paste the new password (from your clipboard, generated in step 4) into the "New Password" and "Confirm New Password" fields on the website.
    *   Save the changes on the website. **Ensure the website confirms the password change was successful.**

6.  **Update the Password in Your `pass` Store:**
    Now that the password has been successfully changed on the service, update it in `pass`.
    *   **Option A: Edit the existing entry:**
        ```bash
        pass edit Web/example-service.com
        ```
        Your editor will open with the old password (and any other metadata). Replace the old password line with the new password (which should still be in your clipboard or you can re-copy it from `pass Temp/new_password_for_example_service`). Save and close.
    *   **Option B: Overwrite with `pass generate -f` (if no other metadata in the file):**
        If your `pass` entry *only* contains the password and no other important metadata (like username, notes, OTP URI), you can directly overwrite it. First, retrieve the password from the temporary entry if needed:
        ```bash
        NEW_PASSWORD=$(pass show Temp/new_password_for_example_service | head -n 1)
        pass insert -f Web/example-service.com <<< "$NEW_PASSWORD"
        # Or, if you want pass to regenerate it directly into the final location AND overwrite:
        # pass generate -f -c Web/example-service.com 20 # (This generates a NEW password again)
        # Be careful with the -f (force) flag.
        ```
        Using `pass edit` (Option A) is generally safer if you have metadata.

7.  **Clean Up Temporary Entry (if used):**
    If you used a temporary `pass` entry, delete it:
    ```bash
    pass rm Temp/new_password_for_example_service
    ```

8.  **Synchronize Changes:**
    ```bash
    pass git push
    ```

## 4. How Often to Rotate Passwords?

There's ongoing debate about the optimal frequency for mandatory password rotation if there's no indication of compromise.
*   **High-Security Accounts (email, financial):** Consider changing every 3-6 months, or immediately after any security incident related to the service or your accounts.
*   **Other Accounts:** Annually, or when a service announces a breach.
*   **Focus on Uniqueness and Strength:** Having a unique, strong password for every site (facilitated by `pass`) is often more impactful than frequent rotation of mediocre passwords.
*   **If a service you use is breached:** Change your password for that service *immediately*, and for any other service where you might have (even accidentally) reused that password or a similar one.

## 5. Checking for Breached Passwords

Services like "Have I Been Pwned" ([haveibeenpwned.com](https://haveibeenpwned.com/)) allow you to check if your email addresses have appeared in known data breaches. If an account associated with your email is listed, change its password. Some password managers integrate checks against breached password databases; `pass` itself does not, but you can manually check important credentials.

By using `pass` to generate and store unique, strong passwords, and by following a sensible rotation schedule for critical accounts, you significantly improve your overall digital security.
