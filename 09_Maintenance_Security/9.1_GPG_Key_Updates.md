# üõ°Ô∏è Updating GPG Keys (Expiration & Renewal)

**Page Objective:** This page explains how to manage GPG key expiration dates, renew your keys (master key and subkeys) before they expire, and considerations for distributing updated public keys.

Setting expiration dates on your GPG keys is a good security practice. It limits the time window an old, potentially compromised key (if that were to happen) could be considered valid. `pass` itself will continue to work with an expired GPG key for decryption (as long as you have the private key), but other GPG functions and interactions might be affected, and it's good hygiene to keep keys current.

## 1. Checking Key Expiration Dates

First, check the current expiration dates of your master key and subkeys:
```bash
gpg --list-keys YOUR_GPG_MASTER_KEY_ID_OR_EMAIL
```
Look for the `[expires: YYYY-MM-DD]` part next to your `sec` (master key) and `ssb` (subkey) entries.

## 2. Renewing a GPG Key (Changing Expiration Date)

You will use the `gpg --edit-key` command.

1.  Start editing your key:
    ```bash
    gpg --edit-key YOUR_GPG_MASTER_KEY_ID_OR_EMAIL
    ```
    You are now at the `gpg>` prompt.

2.  **Renewing the Master Key:**
    *   If the master key itself is selected (no specific subkey selected, or type `key 0` if a subkey is selected to go back to the master key), change its expiration:
        ```
        gpg> expire
        ```
        GPG will ask: `Changing expiration time for the primary key.`
        `Please specify how long the key should be valid.`
        Enter a new validity period (e.g., `1y` for one year, `2y` for two years, or `0` for no expiration, though having an expiration is generally recommended).
        Confirm the new expiration date.

3.  **Renewing a Subkey:**
    *   First, list the keys within the `gpg>` prompt to see their numbers:
        ```
        gpg> list
        ```
        You'll see output like:
        ```
        sec  rsa4096/ABCDEFGH12345678  created: 2023-01-01  expires: 2025-01-01
        ssb  rsa4096/IJKLMNOP98765432  created: 2023-01-01  expires: 2024-01-01  usage: E
        ssb  rsa4096/QRSTUVWXYZABCDEF  created: 2023-01-01  expires: 2024-01-01  usage: S
        ```
        The master key is implicitly key 0. Subkeys are numbered (though not explicitly shown as 1, 2, etc. in the list here, GPG understands selection by number).
    *   Select the subkey you want to renew by its number. For example, to select the first subkey (often the encryption subkey if created in that order):
        ```
        gpg> key 1
        ```
        An asterisk `*` will appear next to the selected subkey (e.g., `ssb* rsa4096/...`).
    *   Change its expiration:
        ```
        gpg> expire
        ```
        GPG will ask: `Changing expiration time for a subkey.`
        `Please specify how long the key should be valid.`
        Enter a new validity period (e.g., `1y`).
        Confirm the new expiration date.
    *   To unselect the subkey and go back to selecting the master key (or to select another subkey), you can type `key <number>` again or `key 0` for the master. For example, to renew the second subkey:
        ```
        gpg> key 2
        gpg> expire
        # ... follow prompts ...
        ```

4.  **Save Changes:**
    After updating all desired expiration dates, save your changes:
    ```
    gpg> save
    ```
    You will likely be prompted for your GPG passphrase to authorize these changes to your secret key.

## 3. Effect on `pass`

*   **Decryption:** `pass` will continue to decrypt passwords encrypted with your key, even if the key's "validity" period has passed, as long as you possess the private key and it hasn't been revoked.
*   **Encryption:** When `pass` encrypts a *new* password or *re-encrypts* an existing one (e.g., after `pass edit`), GPG will use the current state of your key. If your key is marked as expired in your local keyring, GPG might issue warnings or potentially refuse to encrypt for an expired key depending on its policies and version. Keeping your keys "unexpired" by updating their validity ensures smooth operation.

**Important:** Changing the expiration date of your key only affects your local copy of the key and how GPG treats it.

## 4. Distributing Your Updated Public Key (If Necessary)

If other people use your public GPG key (e.g., to send you encrypted emails or if you share `pass` entries where they encrypt *for you*), you need to provide them with your updated public key after you change its expiration date.

1.  **Export your updated public key:**
    ```bash
    gpg --export --armor YOUR_GPG_MASTER_KEY_ID_OR_EMAIL > my_updated_public_key.asc
    ```
2.  **Share `my_updated_public_key.asc`** with them (e.g., via email, key server).
3.  They will need to import it into their GPG keyring to refresh their copy of your key:
    ```bash
    # On their machine
    gpg --import my_updated_public_key.asc
    ```

If you are the only one using this GPG key for `pass` and don't share it for other purposes, you primarily update the expiration for your own GPG hygiene and to ensure local GPG operations don't complain about expired keys.

## 5. What if a Key Expires?

If your key (especially the encryption subkey used by `pass`) genuinely expires in your keyring before you update its validity:
*   You can still decrypt existing passwords with `pass`.
*   When creating *new* passwords or *editing* existing ones, `pass` (via GPG) might:
    *   Warn you that the key is expired.
    *   Potentially refuse to encrypt for an expired key, depending on GPG version and configuration.
*   You would then follow the steps above (`gpg --edit-key ...`) to extend its validity period.

Regularly checking and updating your GPG key expiration dates is a good maintenance habit. Set a calendar reminder before your keys are due to expire.
