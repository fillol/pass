# üíª Initializing the Git Repository for `pass`

**Page Objective:** This page guides you through setting up a local Git repository within your newly initialized `~/.password-store` directory and connecting it to the remote bare repository you created on your self-hosted server.

This allows `pass` to use Git for versioning and synchronization.

## 1. Navigate to Your Password Store Directory

Open your terminal and change to the `pass` store directory:
```bash
cd ~/.password-store
```

## 2. Initialize a Local Git Repository

If `pass init` didn't already initialize a Git repository (you can check with `git status`), initialize one now:
```bash
git init
```
It's good practice to set your default branch name to `main` if Git hasn't done so already (older Git versions might default to `master`):
```bash
# Check current branch name with 'git branch'
# If it's master and you want main:
git branch -M main
```

## 3. Configure Your Git User Name and Email (Locally for This Repository)

It's important that commits made from this machine are attributed to you. While you might have global Git settings, you can also set them per repository. If you haven't configured your Git name and email globally, or want to use specific ones for `pass`, do it now:
```bash
# This sets it for the current repository only
git config user.name "Your Name"
git config user.email "your.email@example.com"
```
Replace `"Your Name"` and `"your.email@example.com"` with your actual name and email (ideally the same ones associated with your GPG key).

## 4. Add the Remote Server

Now, tell your local Git repository where the remote server is. This is the bare repository you set up in [Section 4.3](../04_Server_Git_Setup/4.3_Creating_the_Bare_Repository.md).

The command is `git remote add <name> <url>`.
*   `<name>` is a shorthand for the remote, conventionally `origin`.
*   `<url>` is the SSH URL to your server's repository. It will be in the format:
    `YOUR_SERVER_GIT_USER@YOUR_SERVER_HOSTNAME_OR_IP:YOUR_GIT_REPO_PATH_ON_SERVER`

    *   If `YOUR_GIT_REPO_PATH_ON_SERVER` is relative to `YOUR_SERVER_GIT_USER`'s home directory (e.g., `password-store.git` when the full path is `/home/YOUR_SERVER_GIT_USER/password-store.git`), the URL can be:
        `YOUR_SERVER_GIT_USER@YOUR_SERVER_HOSTNAME_OR_IP:password-store.git`
    *   If `YOUR_GIT_REPO_PATH_ON_SERVER` is an absolute path (e.g., `/srv/git/password-store.git`), the URL must be:
        `YOUR_SERVER_GIT_USER@YOUR_SERVER_HOSTNAME_OR_IP:/srv/git/password-store.git` (note the colon before the absolute path).

Execute the command:
```bash
# Replace with your actual server details and repository path
git remote add origin YOUR_SERVER_GIT_USER@YOUR_SERVER_HOSTNAME_OR_IP:YOUR_GIT_REPO_PATH_ON_SERVER
```
For example:
`git remote add origin gitpass@mypass.server.com:password-store.git`
or
`git remote add origin gitpass@192.168.1.100:/srv/git/password-store.git`

## 5. Verify Remote Configuration

Check that the remote was added correctly:
```bash
git remote -v
```
This should show your `origin` remote listed with both fetch and push URLs, for example:
```
origin  YOUR_SERVER_GIT_USER@YOUR_SERVER_HOSTNAME_OR_IP:YOUR_GIT_REPO_PATH_ON_SERVER (fetch)
origin  YOUR_SERVER_GIT_USER@YOUR_SERVER_HOSTNAME_OR_IP:YOUR_GIT_REPO_PATH_ON_SERVER (push)
```

## 6. (Optional) SSH Configuration for Specific Key or Port

If your SSH connection to the server requires a specific private key (not `~/.ssh/id_ed25519` or `~/.ssh/id_rsa`) or a non-standard port, you should configure your `~/.ssh/config` file on this client machine.

Create or edit `~/.ssh/config` and add an entry like:
```
Host your-pass-server-alias # An alias you choose, e.g., pass.server
    HostName YOUR_SERVER_HOSTNAME_OR_IP
    User YOUR_SERVER_GIT_USER
    # Uncomment and set if using a non-default SSH key for this connection
    # IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_pass_server
    # Uncomment and set if your server's SSH daemon listens on a non-standard port
    # Port 2222
```
Make sure the `~/.ssh/config` file has restrictive permissions:
```bash
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/config
```
If you use an alias from `~/.ssh/config` (e.g., `your-pass-server-alias`), then your `git remote add` command would use that alias instead of the full `USER@HOST` part:
`git remote add origin your-pass-server-alias:YOUR_GIT_REPO_PATH_ON_SERVER` (if path is absolute on server)
or
`git remote add origin your-pass-server-alias:password-store.git` (if path is relative to git user's home on server)

Your local password store directory is now a Git repository and knows where your remote server is. The next step is to make your first commit and push it to the server.
