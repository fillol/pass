# üíª Installing `pass` and Related Tools on Arch Linux

**Page Objective:** This page guides you through installing `pass`, Git, and other essential and useful tools on your Arch Linux system with KDE Plasma (Wayland) to effectively manage your passwords.

To use `pass` and integrate it well with your desktop environment, several packages are needed.

## 1. Update Your System

Before installing new packages, it's always a good practice to ensure your Arch Linux system is up-to-date. Open Konsole or your preferred terminal:
```bash
sudo pacman -Syu
```
Confirm any prompts to proceed with the update.

## 2. Install Core Packages: `pass` and `git`

*   **`pass`**: The password manager itself.
*   **`git`**: For version control and synchronization with your server.

Install them using pacman:
```bash
sudo pacman -S pass git
```

## 3. Install KDE/Qt Specific GUI: `qtpass`

While `pass` is a command-line tool, `qtpass` provides an excellent Qt-based graphical interface that integrates well with KDE Plasma.
```bash
sudo pacman -S qtpass
```

## 4. Install Wayland Clipboard Utility: `wl-clipboard`

For `pass` (and `qtpass`) to correctly copy passwords to the clipboard when using Wayland (which is common with modern KDE Plasma setups), you need `wl-clipboard`. This package provides `wl-copy` and `wl-paste`.
```bash
sudo pacman -S wl-clipboard
```
`pass` is usually smart enough to detect and use `wl-copy` if `xclip` (for X11) is not found or if it identifies a Wayland session.

## 5. Install Optional but Recommended Tools

These tools enhance the functionality of `pass`:

*   **`tree`**: Useful for visualizing the directory structure of your password store from the command line.
    ```bash
    sudo pacman -S tree
    ```

*   **`pass-otp`**: An extension for `pass` to manage Time-based One-Time Passwords (TOTP) for two-factor authentication (2FA). It requires `oathtool`.
    ```bash
    sudo pacman -S pass-otp oathtool
    ```
    We will cover using `pass-otp` in the [Advanced Features section (8.1)](../08_Advanced_Features/8.1_Pass_OTP.md).

*   **Browser Integration (Optional, Covered Later):**
    Tools like `browserpass-chromium` or `browserpass-firefox` (along with their corresponding browser extensions) allow seamless integration of `pass` with your web browser. Installation of these will be detailed in the [Browser Integration section (8.2)](../08_Advanced_Features/8.2_Browser_Integration.md) if you choose to set them up. For now, ensure the core components are installed.

## 6. Verify Installations (Optional)

You can verify that the main packages are installed:
```bash
pass --version
git --version
qtpass --version
wl-copy --version
```
These commands should output the respective versions of the installed software.

With these tools installed, your Arch Linux system is prepared to initialize and use `pass`. The next step is to initialize your password store with your GPG key.
