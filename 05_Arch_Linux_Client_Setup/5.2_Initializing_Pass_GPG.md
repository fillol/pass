# üíª Initializing `pass` with Your GPG Key

**Page Objective:** This page explains how to initialize your password store on Arch Linux using the GPG encryption subkey you identified earlier.

Initialization sets up the directory where your passwords will be stored and tells `pass` which GPG key to use for encryption.

## 1. Ensure Your GPG Key is Available

Before initializing `pass`, make sure the GPG keypair (specifically, the secret key part corresponding to your encryption subkey) is available in your local GPG keyring on your Arch Linux machine.

1.  **If you generated the key on this machine:** It should already be available.
2.  **If you generated it elsewhere:** You must import the **secret key**. Refer to the GPG documentation or the [Secure GPG Key Backup & Revocation Certificate section (3.2)](../03_GPG_Setup/3.2_Backup_and_Revocation.md) for importing (using `gpg --import your_secret_key.asc`).

3.  **Verify the key's presence and identify the ID:**
    List your secret keys, paying attention to the subkey marked `[E]`.
    ```bash
    gpg --list-secret-keys --keyid-format long YOUR_GPG_MASTER_KEY_ID_OR_EMAIL
    ```
    Confirm you see the `ssb` line with `[E]` and note its ID (e.g., `0x1234567890ABCDEF`). This is `YOUR_GPG_ENCRYPTION_SUBKEY_ID`.

4.  **Ensure GPG Agent is Working:**
    Try encrypting a test file or performing a GPG operation. If you have `gpg-agent` and `pinentry-qt` configured (as discussed in [Section 3.3](../03_GPG_Setup/3.3_GPG_Agent_KDE.md)), you should be prompted for your GPG passphrase in a graphical window (and potentially offered to save it in KWallet). This confirms GPG is ready.

## 2. Initialize `pass`

Now, use the `pass init` command with the GPG ID (or multiple IDs if you plan to share) to create the password store. It's crucial to use the **ID of the encryption subkey**.

```bash
# Replace YOUR_GPG_ENCRYPTION_SUBKEY_ID with the actual ID you noted.
# If you want multiple people/keys to access, list all their GPG IDs here.
pass init YOUR_GPG_ENCRYPTION_SUBKEY_ID
```

This command will:
*   Create the password store directory at `~/.password-store/`.
*   Create a hidden file named `~/.password-store/.gpg-id`.
*   Write `YOUR_GPG_ENCRYPTION_SUBKEY_ID` into the `.gpg-id` file.

## 3. Verify the Initialization

1.  **Check if the directory exists:**
    ```bash
    ls -d ~/.password-store/
    ```
    This should show the directory name.

2.  **Check the content of the `.gpg-id` file:**
    ```bash
    cat ~/.password-store/.gpg-id
    ```
    This should display the GPG ID you provided during initialization.

Your password store is now initialized locally and configured to use your GPG key for encryption. Any new password you add will be encrypted using this key.

The next step is to turn this local directory into a Git repository and link it to your self-hosted server.
