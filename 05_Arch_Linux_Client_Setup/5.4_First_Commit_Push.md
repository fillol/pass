# üíª First Commit and Push & `.gitignore`

**Page Objective:** This page covers making your first commit to the local `pass` Git repository, creating a `.gitignore` file to exclude unnecessary files, adding a test password, and pushing everything to your self-hosted server to verify the complete synchronization setup.

At this point, your `~/.password-store` is initialized for both `pass` (with a `.gpg-id` file) and `git` (linked to your remote).

## 1. Navigate to Your Password Store Directory

If you're not already there, change to the `pass` store directory:
```bash
cd ~/.password-store
```

## 2. Check Git Status

See what Git currently tracks or considers for staging:
```bash
git status
```
You should see at least the `.gpg-id` file as an "untracked file" or "changes to be committed" if `pass init` or a previous `git add` command staged it.

## 3. Create a `.gitignore` File

It's good practice to add a `.gitignore` file to your password store to prevent Git from tracking temporary files, editor backups, or system-specific metadata.

Create a file named `.gitignore` in the `~/.password-store/` directory with the following content:
```
# Editor backup files
*~
*.swp
*.swo
*.bak
*.tmp

# macOS specific
.DS_Store

# QtPass specific (if any local cache/temp files are created - usually not needed in .gitignore)
# .qtpass_something_temp

# Other system or temporary files
Thumbs.db
desktop.ini
```
You can create this file using a text editor or directly from the command line:
```bash
echo -e "*~\n*.swp\n*.swo\n*.bak\n*.tmp\n\n# macOS specific\n.DS_Store\n\n# Other system or temporary files\nThumbs.db\ndesktop.ini" > ~/.password-store/.gitignore
```

## 4. Stage Initial Files for Commit

Add the `.gpg-id` file (which tells `pass` which GPG key to use) and your new `.gitignore` file to the Git staging area:
```bash
git add .gpg-id
git add .gitignore
```
You can verify they are staged with `git status`.

## 5. Make Your First Commit

Commit these initial configuration files to your local Git repository:
```bash
git commit -m "Initial commit: Add .gpg-id and .gitignore"
```
You should see output confirming the commit, listing the files changed.

## 6. Add a Test Password using `pass`

Let's add a sample password to ensure the `pass` command itself works and to have something more to push.
```bash
# This will prompt you to enter and confirm a password for "test/example.com"
pass insert test/example.com
```
*   You will be prompted for your GPG passphrase (if not cached by `gpg-agent`).
*   `pass` will create an encrypted file `~/.password-store/test/example.com.gpg`.
*   `pass` automatically runs `git add test/example.com.gpg` and `git commit -m "Add given password for test/example.com to store."` for you.

You can verify this by running `git log` to see the commit history.

## 7. Push to Your Remote Server

Now, push your local commits (the initial setup and the test password) to the `origin` remote on the `main` branch (or `master` if that's your default).
The `-u` flag sets the upstream branch, so future `git push` and `git pull` commands from this branch will automatically know where to go.

```bash
git push -u origin main
```
*   If your SSH key is passphrase-protected and not managed by `ssh-agent`, you'll be prompted for your SSH key's passphrase.
*   If the connection to the server and SSH authentication are set up correctly (as per [Section 4.4](../04_Server_Git_Setup/4.4_Configuring_SSH_Access.md)), the push should succeed. You'll see output similar to:
    ```
    Enumerating objects: 5, done.
    Counting objects: 100% (5/5), done.
    Delta compression using up to X threads
    Compressing objects: 100% (3/3), done.
    Writing objects: 100% (4/4), XYZ bytes | XYZ KiB/s, done.
    Total 4 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0
    To YOUR_SERVER_GIT_USER@YOUR_SERVER_HOSTNAME_OR_IP:YOUR_GIT_REPO_PATH_ON_SERVER
     * [new branch]      main -> main
    Branch 'main' set up to track remote branch 'main' from 'origin'.
    ```

## 8. Verify on the Server (Optional)

You can log into your server and check the bare repository to see if the objects have arrived. You won't see the files directly, but the repository's internal structure will have been updated.
```bash
# On your server
# sudo su - YOUR_SERVER_GIT_USER
cd YOUR_GIT_REPO_PATH_ON_SERVER
git log --all # This might not work directly in a bare repo easily
# A better check for a bare repo is to see if refs/heads/main exists
ls refs/heads/
```
You should see `main` (or `master`) listed.

Congratulations! Your Arch Linux `pass` client is now fully configured, has its first password, and is successfully synchronizing with your self-hosted Git server.
